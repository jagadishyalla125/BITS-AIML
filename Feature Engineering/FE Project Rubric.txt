Data Quality   - 7 marks
========================
duplicate  records - 1 
target label missing - 1
data integrity - 2 
	order time and delivery time check
	negative distance
	rating check - zero value acceptable 	
	negative discount 
missing values - 3
	discount  - replace with zero
	delivery charges - replace with zero
	surge charges - replace with zero
	packagind charges - replace with zero
	tip - replace with zero
	order id - replace with some unique value or drop it 
	promo code - - replace with new category

Data Transformation - 10
========================
To be computed -- 4.5
	Delivery time requird for actual delivery in minutes   - from DateTime and Delivery Time - 1                 --- 2 
	Bill amount from Cost - Discount + Delivery charges + Surge charges + Packaging charges	+ ST + Tip           --- 0.5 
	Order type - veg / nonveg / mix from Items                                                                   --- 2

To be converted    -- 0.5
	Status to binary 0 /1

Dummy variables - 1.5
	PromoCode
	Payment mode
	Membership

Normalization of numeric columns - 1.5

Data Reduction - 2
To be dropped - 2
	ID
	Provider
	DateTime
	Delivery Time
	PromoCode
	Payment mode
	Items
	Membership

EDA - 6
========================
Univariate analysis  of each attribute- 2
	Packaging charges - same values - can be dropped
	ST - same values - can be dropped

Coorelation between predictors  - 2
find and drop highly correlated attribtues
	distance and delivery time
	wallet and discount

Relation between each predictor and target - 2
	Look specificaly for
		Delivery time 
		Amount 
		Status
		Discount
		Payment modes
		
Feature selection and Modeling - 5
==================================
Backward stepwise feature elimination - 5
roughly each iteration 1 mark
	In each iteration
		feature selection - 0.25 
		model building - 0.5
		error observation and conclusion about included feature - 0.25
		

Model explanation - 2 
=====================
Generalized model obtained with good accuracy - 1 mark
Comparison of model parameters done with observations from EDA - 1 mark

BONUS --- Overall neatness + approach + explanation - 2 marks
