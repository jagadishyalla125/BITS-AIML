A communication studies professor says he's not surprised that people are looking to reconnect with others they were once close to. “This is an utter reshuffling of people's social lives, in a way that's very, very dramatic and probably different than anything we've ever seen before,” said Dr. Jeffrey Hall, Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Kansas. Dr. Hall has been working with colleagues to collect data on how people are getting social needs met while in quarantine. One thing they've found so far is that taking the initiative to reach out can improve mental health. Dr. Hall has also been exploring why we don't normally keep in touch, even though it's easier than ever with technology. He says we typically get enough social interaction just through casual conversations with others, like at work or in your neighborhood. However, that's changed. “We don't have that,” said Dr. Hall. “So, what that means is we basically have a huge gap of people who we would normally make sense of the world with, and that's being replaced by either the people who are in our households, or people who we have, prior to, not seen very often.</td>\n",

Before the news, the Cowboys released a safe return plan for it's football student-athletes and indicted what would happen if a player tested positive for COVID-19: If a student-athlete, coach or support staff member tests positive for COVID-19, they will enter the quarantine protocol per medical, local/state health department and university guidelines and will begin to receive the appropriate monitoring and treatment from the team physician, athletic training staff and any other medical consultants. The positive student-athlete will be moved to separate housing designated by OSU for quarantine purposes. Appropriate contact tracing as per local/state health department and university guidelines will begin and all that have been in contact will be instructed to quarantine and have symptoms monitored for a period determined by health and medical officials. Contact tracing will begin with the student-athlete’s cohort/workout group. After the determined quarantine time, if the traced contact group is not showing symptoms, they will be retested for COVID-19 prior to resuming activities. Upon receiving a negative test, they will await specific instructions from the team physician and/or the athletic training staff regarding a return to activities. Upon recognition of symptomatic student-athletes and/or staff in the west end zone facility, the person will immediately be referred and directed to OSU University Health Services (or Stillwater Medical Center if after working hours) for evaluation, testing and treatment. If needed, transportation to University Health Services or Stillwater Medical Center for symptomatic student-athletes will be provided from athletic training staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Ogbongbemiga finished with 100 total tackles, five sacks and one interception last year for the Cowboys.</td>\n",

Before the news, the Cowboys released a safe return plan for it's football student-athletes and indicted what would happen if a player tested positive for COVID-19: If a student-athlete, coach or support staff member tests positive for COVID-19, they will enter the quarantine protocol per medical, local/state health department and university guidelines and will begin to receive the appropriate monitoring and treatment from the team physician, athletic training staff and any other medical consultants. The positive student-athlete will be moved to separate housing designated by OSU for quarantine purposes. Appropriate contact tracing as per local/state health department and university guidelines will begin and all that have been in contact will be instructed to quarantine and have symptoms monitored for a period determined by health and medical officials. Contact tracing will begin with the student-athlete’s cohort/workout group. After the determined quarantine time, if the traced contact group is not showing symptoms, they will be retested for COVID-19 prior to resuming activities. Upon receiving a negative test, they will await specific instructions from the team physician and/or the athletic training staff regarding a return to activities. Upon recognition of symptomatic student-athletes and/or staff in the west end zone facility, the person will immediately be referred and directed to OSU University Health Services (or Stillwater Medical Center if after working hours) for evaluation, testing and treatment. If needed, transportation to University Health Services or Stillwater Medical Center for symptomatic student-athletes will be provided from athletic training staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment.

A communication studies professor says he's not surprised that people are looking to reconnect with others they were once close to. “This is an utter reshuffling of people's social lives, in a way that's very, very dramatic and probably different than anything we've ever seen before,” said Dr. Jeffrey Hall, Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Kansas. Dr. Hall has been working with colleagues to collect data on how people are getting social needs met while in quarantine. One thing they've found so far is that taking the initiative to reach out can improve mental health. Dr. Hall has also been exploring why we don't normally keep in touch, even though it's easier than ever with technology. He says we typically get enough social interaction just through casual conversations with others, like at work or in your neighborhood. However, that's changed. “We don't have that,” said Dr. Hall. “So, what that means is we basically have a huge gap of people who we would normally make sense of the world with, and that's being replaced by either the people who are in our households, or people who we have, prior to, not seen very often.</td>\n",

A communication studies professor says he's not surprised that people are looking to reconnect with others they were once close to. “This is an utter reshuffling of people's social lives, in a way that's very, very dramatic and probably different than anything we've ever seen before,” said Dr. Jeffrey Hall, Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Kansas. Dr. Hall has been working with colleagues to collect data on how people are getting social needs met while in quarantine. One thing they've found so far is that taking the initiative to reach out can improve mental health. Dr. Hall has also been exploring why we don't normally keep in touch, even though it's easier than ever with technology. He says we typically get enough social interaction just through casual conversations with others, like at work or in your neighborhood. However, that's changed. “We don't have that,” said Dr. Hall. “So, what that means is we basically have a huge gap of people who we would normally make sense of the world with, and that's being replaced by either the people who are in our households, or people who we have, prior to, not seen very often.   \n",

That's because if it has to be through phone calls or texts, we'd rather connect with someone we really want to talk to. Maintaining a rekindled friendship comes down to making a habit of it, in whatever your new normal routine may be. That could be as simple as making plans to talk once a month.

Before the news, the Cowboys released a safe return plan for it's football student-athletes and indicted what would happen if a player tested positive for COVID-19: If a student-athlete, coach or support staff member tests positive for COVID-19, they will enter the quarantine protocol per medical, local/state health department and university guidelines and will begin to receive the appropriate monitoring and treatment from the team physician, athletic training staff and any other medical consultants. The positive student-athlete will be moved to separate housing designated by OSU for quarantine purposes. Appropriate contact tracing as per local/state health department and university guidelines will begin and all that have been in contact will be instructed to quarantine and have symptoms monitored for a period determined by health and medical officials. Contact tracing will begin with the student-athlete’s cohort/workout group. After the determined quarantine time, if the traced contact group is not showing symptoms, they will be retested for COVID-19 prior to resuming activities. Upon receiving a negative test, they will await specific instructions from the team physician and/or the athletic training staff regarding a return to activities. Upon recognition of symptomatic student-athletes and/or staff in the west end zone facility, the person will immediately be referred and directed to OSU University Health Services (or Stillwater Medical Center if after working hours) for evaluation, testing and treatment. If needed, transportation to University Health Services or Stillwater Medical Center for symptomatic student-athletes will be provided from athletic training staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Ogbongbemiga finished with 100 total tackles, five sacks and one interception last year for the Cowboys.   \n",

The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets among individuals within close personal contact (within 6’) for a prolonged period of time (ten minutes or longer). Anyone with concerns about their risk of exposure can contact the Tulsa Health Department at 918-582-9355. The Tulsa Health Department respects those exercising their right for peaceful assembly. Crowds and large gatherings can be a conduit for the transmission of COVID-19, which is spreading in our community. All residents are encouraged to exercise their right to gather and protest safely, which includes wearing a cloth face covering to protect those around you, use hand sanitizer when soap and water are not readily available, practice social distancing, and avoid touching your face. We want to encourage residents to use their voice, but do so safely. Today, we reported an additional 34 cases and three deaths in our community, bringing the cumulative total to 1,057 and 57 respectively. This story was originally reported by KJRH's Jacob Tobey.
