Shading his eyes with his paws, he exclaimed, \"It \\nis Sly Fox.\" \\n\\n    \"Good morning Mr. Rabbit,\" cried Sly Fox, as he walked across the yard. \\n\"Good morning,\" replied Mr. Rabbit, a slight frown on his face. \\n\\n    \"Well,\" said Sly Fox, \"as I haven\\'t seen you in so long a time, thought \\nI would stop and chat a while.\" \\n\\n    Mr. Rabbit could not be rude in his own home, even to an enemy, so he \\noffered Sly Fox a seat on the porch. \\n\\n    \"Take a chair,\" he said politely. \\tBut Sly Fox did not stay long, and as \\nhe was leaving, he asked: \"Mr. Rabbit, my mother is having a good dinner \\ntonight. Won\\'t you, Mrs. Rabbit, and your three little rabs come to dinner \\nwith me?\" \\n\\n    Oh, thought Mr. Rabbit, he knows about my little rabs and wants to take \\nus off to eat us. He pretended to be disappointed as he replied: \"Sorry, Sly \\nFox, we have an engagement for today, but if you want us we can come \\ntomorrow.\" \\n\\n    At this Sly Fox chuckled inwardly, and readily agreed to come for them \\nthe next day. Wishing Mr. Rabbit \"Good day\", he trotted on down the road \\ntoward his home. \\n\\n    As soon as he was out of sight, Mr. Rabbit ran into his house and called \\nMrs. Rabbit. \"Get all our things together,\" he said, \"and put rubber boots \\non our little rabs. We have to move quickly to the Piney Woods across the \\nbrook. Old Sly Fox has found our home and will destroy us.\" \\n\\n    In no time at all the Rabbit family had moved, and the little rabs were \\ndelighted with their new home. A woodland of towering pines it was, the \\nground covered with pine needles which made a soft carpeting. The wind made \\nmusic in the pine trees, birds sang, and the fragrance of flowers filled the \\nair. They found a huge hollow tree where Mr. Rabbit burrowed deep and made \\nthem a cozy home. Squirrels had left nuts hidden around in the old tree. \\nOwls hooted throughout the night, crickets chirped merrily. \\n\\n    Next morning old Sly Fox knocked on the door where he had left Mr. \\nRabbit. Mrs. Hedgehog answered the door. \"Good morning, Mrs. Hedgehog. Is \\nMr. Rabbit in?\" inquired Sly Fox with a wicked grin and a cunning look in \\nhis eyes. \\n\\n    \"No,\" replied Mrs. Eedgehog, none too cordially. \"The Rabbit family \\nmoved to parts unknown right after you left yesterday.\" \\n\\n    \"Ah,\" exclaimed old Sly Fox, \"Mr. Rabbit and family were going to have \\ndinner with me. My mother has planned a real feast. Why don\\'t you come and \\nenjoy it with us?\" \\n\\n    \"Oh,\" replied Mrs. Hedgehog, smacking her lips and thinking of all the \\ngoodies, \"I have just moved in and there is so much to do! Why not let it go \\nuntil tomorrow?\" \\n\\n    \"Do you like nice young grasshoppers?\" asked Sly Fox softly. \\n\\n    \"Do I? Nothing so good as tender young grasshoppers,\" answered Mrs. \\nHedgehog, fairly dribbling at the mouth at the thought of such a dainty. \\n\\n    \"Well,\" said Sly Fox, \"we pass a field where there are any number of \\nthem. Come get in this sack, and when I stop in the field we will open the \\nsack and rake in all of them we want. Mother will bake them with apples and \\nthey will be deilicious!\" This was too much for greedy Mrs. Hedgehog to \\nresist, so in the sack she went. Sly Fox with a grin grabbed the sack, threw \\nit over his shoulder and trotted toward home. \\tAfter going a long way, Mrs. \\nHedgehog became suspicious and cried, \"How long before we reach that field \\nof grasshoppers?\" \\n\\n    \"Why, you silly, greedy hedgehog, there is no field of grasshoppers for \\nyou. I am going to eat you for my dinner. It\\'s you with apple dumplings that \\nmy mother will bake.\" \\n\\n    Every hair on Mrs. Hedgehog\\'s head stood on end with fright. Oh, how \\nfoolish she had been! Her greed had trapped her. If only she had stayed home \\nand straightened her house and cooked her own dinner, she would not have \\nbeen in this sack to be eaten by Sly Fox. Greediness never pays, she thought \\nto herself. \\n\\n    Sly Fox became tired, and as a slight rain had begun to fall, he looked \\nfor a dry place to sit down. Throwing the sack to the ground and chuckling \\nat the thought of sitting on Mrs. Hedgehog, he dropped heavily upon the \\nsack. \\n\\n    \"Wow, Wow!\" he cried, jumping quickly up, for Mrs. Hedgehog shot her \\nsharp quills into him with all her might. \\n\\n    Sly Fox ran to and fro trying to pull out the quills, but they had gone \\ntoo deep. Home he ran, screaming to his mother. Old Mother Fox threw him \\nover a log and began pulling out the quills, at the same time calling to a \\nneighbor fox to bring some honey to put on the places where the quills had \\nbeen. \\n\\n    Mrs. Hedgehog crawled out of the bag and began walking slowly toward \\nhome. She thought to herself that never again would she be so greedy and \\nallow herself to be fooled by Sly Fox or any one else. \\n\\n    Meanwhile, Mr. Rabbit and family were living happily in Piney Woods. The \\nlittle rabs played on the crystal clear brook that ran through the woods, \\nwading, sailing little leaf boats, and trying to catch the silvery minnows \\ndarting here and there. \\n\\n    Late one evening Papa and Mama Rabbit were sitting before the cozy fire \\ntalking. Papa Rabbit had on his house robe and bedroom slippers, reading the \\nnewspaper. Every now and then he looked over his spectacles lovingly at \\ndainty little Mama Rabbit, dressed in a flowered housecoat and red slippers \\nand knitting little socks for the little rabs. \\n\\n    \"Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!\" came suddenly to their ears. \\n\\n    \"Sly Fox!\" whispered Papa Rabbit, his face now full of concern and \\nalarm. \\n\\n    \"Yes,\" agreed Mama Rabbit, her voice trembling with fright. \\n\\n    \"Go cover the little rabs with straw and tell them to be very, very \\nquiet,\" instructed Papa Rabbit. \\n\\n    Mrs. Rabbit quickly covered the little rabs and cautioned them to be as \\nquiet as mice. Since they were well behaved and obedient little rabs, they \\ndid just as their mother told them. \\n\\n    \"I left my big stick beside the old oak tree,\" cried Papa Rabbit under \\nhis breath. \"What shall we do?\" \\n\\n    \"Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!\" went Sly Fox again, scratching up the earth by \\nthe old hollow tree as he began to dig furiously. The poor little Rabbit \\nfamily sat still and frightened, their hearts thumping, their paws shaking, \\nand their eyes bulging with panic. Suddenly in the distance they heard the \\n\"Toot! Toot!Toot!\" of horns, and the \"Woof! Woof! Woof!\" of barking dogs. \\n\\n    Papa Rabbit whispered, \"Fox hunters!\" as his heart gave a bound of \\nrelief. \\n\\n    Nearer and nearer came the baying of the hounds and the music of the \\nhorns. Old Sly Fox was so busily digging that he failed to hear at first, \\nbut suddenly he stopped digging, and threw back his ears to listen. Then he \\nquickly jumped away from the log where the Rabbit family lived and started \\nrunning. \\n\\n    But the hounds were right after him, baying loudly with all their might. \\nThe horses\\' feet beat out an excited rhythm as the red-coated fox hunters \\nurged them on in the chase. Up hill, over the meadows they ran. \\n\\n    Sly Fox was now running for his life, but the dogs were getting closer \\nand closer. He jumped across the brook and spied a hole among some bushes. \\nInto this he slid, and as the dogs went down the side of the stream of water \\nbefore they jumped across they lost his scent. Sly Fox quickly ran out of \\nthe hole and took off in the opposite direction from the way the dogs were \\ngoing. He had been so frightened and so near death that he resolved to \\nhimself never to bother the Rabbit family again. \\n\\n    Meanwhile, when Papa Rabbit had heard the hounds start the chase, he \\nturned to Mama Rabbit and cried, \"Safe at last! Call our little rabs for \\nprayers of thanksgiving and praise to our Father which art in heaven.\" \\n\\n    After prayers, Mama Rabbit hustled about making mint tea for her and \\nPapa Rabbit, and hot chocolate piled high with whipped cream for the little \\nrabs. After that time they Lived happily among the great whispering pines, \\nnever bothered by old Sly Fox.\\n                                                          --Beulah Murrelle \\n\\n', ':.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:\\n         -----=====Earth\\'s Dreamlands=====-----\\n           (313)558-5024 {14.4} (313)558-5517\\n              A BBS for text file junkies\\n              RPGNet GM File Archive Site\\n.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.\\n\\n            The Adveniure of the Three Gables\\n\\n  I don\\'t think that any of my adventures with Mr. Sherlock\\nHolmes opened quite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that\\nwhich I associate with The Three Gables. I had not seen Holmes\\nfor some days and had no idea of the new channel into which his\\nactivities had been directed. He was in a chatty mood that\\nmorning, however, and had just settled me into the well-worn\\nlow armchair on one side of the fire, while he had curled down\\nwith his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair, when our\\nvisitor arrived. If I had said that a mad bull had arrived it would\\ngive a clearer impression of what occurred.\\n  The door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the\\nroom. He would have been a comic figure if he had not been\\nterrific, for he was dressed in a very loud gray check suit with a\\nflowing salmon-coloured tie. His broad face and flattened nose\\nwere thrust forward, as his sullen dark eyes, with a smouldering\\ngleam of malice in them, turned from one of us to the other.\\n  \"Which of you gen\\'l\\'men is Masser Holmes?\" he asked.\\n  Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile.\\n  \"Oh! it\\'s you, is it?\" said our visitor, coming with an un-\\npleasant, stealthy step round the angle of the table. \"See here,\\nMasser Holmes, you keep your hands out of other folks\\' busi-\\nness. Leave folks to manage their own affairs. Got that, Masser\\nHolmes?\"\\n  \"Keep on talking,\" said Holmes. \"It\\'s fine.\"\\n  \"Oh! it\\'s fine, is it?\" growled the savage. \"It won\\'t be so\\ndamn fine if I have to trim you up a bit. I\\'ve handled your kind\\nbefore now, and they didn\\'t look fine when I was through with\\nthem. Look at that, Masser Holmes!\"\\n  He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend\\'s\\nnose. Holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest.\\n  \"Were you born so?\" he asked. \"Or did it come by degrees?\"\\n  It may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have\\nbeen the slight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker. In\\nany case, our visitor\\'s manner became less flamboyant.\\n  \"Well, I\\'ve given you fair warnin\\',\" said he. \"I\\'ve a friend\\nthat\\'s interested out Harrow way -- you know what I\\'m meaning --\\nand he don\\'t intend to have no buttin\\' in by you. Got that? You\\nain\\'t the law, and I ain\\'t the law either, and if you come in I\\'ll\\nbe on hand also. Don\\'t you forget it.\"\\n  \"I\\'ve wanted to meet you for some time,\" said Holmes. \"I\\nwon\\'t ask you to sit down, for I don\\'t like the smell of you, but\\naren\\'t you Steve Dixie, the bruiser?\"\\n  \"That\\'s my name, Masser Holmes, and you\\'ll get put through\\nit for sure if you give me any lip.\"\\n  \"It is certainly the last thing you need,\" said Holmes, staring\\nat our visitor\\'s hideous mouth. \"But it was the killing of young\\nPerkins outside the Holborn -- Bar What! you\\'re not going?\"\\n  The negro had sprung back, and his face was leaden. \"I won\\'t\\nlisten to no such talk,\" said he. \"What have I to do with this \\'ere\\nPerkins, Masser Holmes? I was trainin\\' at the Bull Ring in\\nBirmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble.\"\\n  \"Yes, you\\'ll tell the magistrate about it, Steve,\" said Holmes.\\n\"I\\'ve been watching you and Barney Stockdale --\"\\n  \"So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes --\"\\n  \"That\\'s enough. Get out of it. I\\'ll pick you up when I want\\nyou.\"\\n  \"Good-mornin\\', Masser Holmes. I hope there ain\\'t no hard\\nfeelin\\'s about this \\'ere visit?\"\\n  \"There will be unless you tell me who sent you.\"\\n  \"Why, there ain\\'t no secret about that, Masser Holmes. It was\\nthat same gen\\'l\\'man that you have just done gone mention.\"\\n  \"And who set him on to it?\"\\n  \"S\\'elp me. I don\\'t know, Masser Holmes. He just say,\\n\\'Steve, you go see Mr. Holmes, and tell him his life ain\\'t\\nsafe if he go down Harrow way.\\' That\\'s the whole truth.\"\\nWithout waiting for any further questioning, our visitor bolted\\nout of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered.\\nHolmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle.\\n  \"I am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head,\\nWatson. I observed your manoeuvres with the poker. But he is\\nreally rather a harmless fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blus-\\ntering baby, and easily cowed, as you have seen. He is one\\nof the Spencer John gang and has taken part in some dirty\\nwork of late which I may clear up when I have time. His\\nimmediate principal, Barney, is a more astute person. They\\nspecialize in assaults, intimidation, and the like. What I want\\nto know is, who is at the back of them on this panicular\\noccasion?\"\\n  \"But why do they want to intimidate you?\"\\n  \"It is this Harrow Weald case. It decides me to look into the\\nmatter, for if it is worth anyone\\'s while to take so much trouble,\\nthere must be something in it.\"\\n  \"But what is it?\"\\n  \"I was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude.\\nHere is Mrs. Maberley\\'s note. If you care to come with me we\\nwill wire her and go out at once.\"\\n\\n     DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES [I read]:\\n       I have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me\\n     in connection with this house, and I should much value your\\n     advice. You would find me at home any time to-morrow.\\n     The house is within a short walk of the Weald Station. I\\n     believe that my late husband, Mortimer Maberley, was one\\n     of your early clients.\\n                                            Yours faithfully,\\n                                               MARY MABERLEY.\\n\\n  The address was \"The Three Gables, Harrow Weald.\"\\n  \"So that\\'s that!\" said Holmes. \"And now, if you can spare\\nthe time, Watson, we will get upon our way.\"\\n  A short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the\\nhouse, a brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of\\nundeveloped grassland. Three small projections above. the upper\\nwindows made a feeble attempt to justify its name. Behind was a\\ngrove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of\\nthe place was poor and depressing. None the less, we found the\\nhouse to be well furnished, and the lady who received us was a\\nmost engaging elderly person, who bore every mark of refine-\\nment and culture.\\n  \"I remember your husband well, madam,\" said Holmes,\\n\"though it is some years since he used my services in some\\ntrifling matter.\"\\n  \"Probably you would be more familiar with the name of my\\nson Douglas.\"\\n  Holmes looked at her with great interest.\\n  \"Dear me! Are you the mother of Douglas Maberley? I knew\\nhim slightly. But of course all London knew him. What a\\nmagnificent creature he was! Where is he now?\"\\n  \"Dead, Mr. Holmes, dead! He was attache at Rome, and he\\ndied there of pneumonia last month.\"\\n  \"I am sorry. One could not connect death with such a man. I\\nhave never known anyone so vitally alive. He lived intensely --\\nevery fibre of him!\"\\n  \"Too intensely, Mr. Holmes. That was the ruin of him. You\\nremember him as he was -- debonair and splendid. You did not\\nsee the moody, morose, brooding creature into which he devel-\\noped. His heart was broken. In a single month I seemed to see\\nmy gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man.\"\\n  \"A love affair -- a woman?\"\\n  \"Or a fiend. Well, it was not to talk of my poor lad that I\\nasked you to come, Mr. Holmes.\"\\n  \"Dr. Watson and I are at your service.\"\\n  \"There have been some very strange happenings. I have been\\nin this house more than a year now, and as I wished to lead a\\nretired life I have seen little of my neighbours. Three days ago I\\nhad a call from a man who said that he was a house agent. He\\nsaid that this house would exactly suit a client of his, and that if I\\nwould part with it money would be no object. It seemed to me\\nvery strange as there are several empty houses on the market\\nwhich appear to be equally eligible, but naturally I was interested\\nin what he said. I therefore named a price which was five\\nhundred pounds more than I gave. He at once closed with the\\noffer, but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as\\nwell and would I put a price upon it. Some of this furniture is\\nfrom my old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so that I\\nnamed a good round sum. To this also he at once agreed. I had\\nalways wanted to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that\\nit really seemed that I should be my own mistress for the rest of\\nmy life.\\n  \"Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out.\\nLuckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer, who lives in\\nHarrow. He said to me, \\'This is a very strange document. Are\\nyou aware that if you sign it you could not legally take anything\\nout of the house -- not even your own private possessions?\\' When\\nthe man came again in the evening I pointed this out, and I said\\nthat I meant only to sell the furniture.\\n  \" \\'No, no, everything,\\' said he.\\n  \" \\'But my clothes? My jewels?\\'\\n  \" \\'Well, well, some concession might be made for your per-\\nsonal effects. But nothing shall go out of the house unchecked.\\nMy client is a very liberal man, but he has his fads and his own\\nway of doing things. It is everything or nothing with him.\\'\\n  \" \\'Then it must be nothing,\\' said I. And there the matter was\\nleft, but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that I\\nthought --\"\\n  Here we had a very extraordinary interruption.\\n  Holmes raised his hand for silence. Then he strode across the\\nroom, flung open the door, and dragged in a great gaunt woman\\nwhom he had seized by the shoulder. She entered with ungainly\\nstruggle like some huge awkward chicken, torn, squawking, out\\nof its coop.\\n  \"Leave me alone! What are you a-doin\\' of?\" she screeched.\\n  \"Why, Susan, what is this?\"\\n  \"Well, ma\\'am, I was comin\\' in to ask if the visitors was\\nstayin\\' for lunch when this man jumped out at me.\"\\n  \"I have been listening to her for the last five minutes, but did\\nnot wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative. Just a little\\nwheezy, Susan, are you not? You breathe too heavily for that\\nkind of work.\"\\n  Susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor. \"Who\\nbe you, anyhow, and what right have you a-pullin\\' me about like\\nthis?\"\\n  \"It was merely that I wished to ask a question in your\\npresence. Did you, Mrs. Maberley, mention to anyone that you\\nwere going to write to me and consult me?\"\\n  \"No, Mr. Holmes, I did not.\"\\n  \"Who posted your letter?\"\\n  \"Susan did.\"\\n  \"Exactly. Now, Susan, to whom was it that you wrote or sent\\na message to say that your mistress was asking advice from\\nme?\"\\n  \"It\\'s a lie. I sent no message.\"\\n  \"Now, Susan, wheezy people may not live long, you know.\\nIt\\'s a wicked thing to tell fibs. Whom did you tell?\"\\n  \"Susan!\" cried her mistress, \"I believe you are a bad, treach-\\nerous woman. I remember now that I saw you speaking to\\nsomeone over the hedge.\"\\n  \"That was my own business,\" said the woman sullenly.\\n  \"Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stockdale to whom you\\nspoke?\" said Holmes.\\n  \"Well, if you know, what do you want to ask for?\"\\n  \"I was not sure, but I know now. Well now, Susan, it will be\\nworth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of\\nBarney.\"\\n  \"Someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every\\nten you have in the world.\"\\n  \"So, a rich man? No; you smiled -- a rich woman. Now we\\nhave got so far, you may as well give the name and earn the\\ntenner.\"\\n  \"I\\'ll see you in hell first.\"\\n  \"Oh, Susan! Language!\"\\n  \"I am clearing out of here. I\\'ve had enough of you all. I\\'ll\\nsend for my box to-morrow.\" She flounced for the door.\\n  \"Good-bye, Susan. Paregoric is the stuff.... Now,\" he\\ncontinued, turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door\\nhad closed behind the flushed and angry woman, \"this gang\\nmeans business. Look how close they play the game. Your letter\\nto me had the 10 P.M. postmark. And yet Susan passes the word\\nto Barney. Barney has time to go to his employer and get\\ninstructions; he or she -- I incline to the latter from Susan\\'s grin\\nwhen she thought I had blundered -- forms a plan. Black Steve is\\ncalled in, and I am warned off by eleven o\\'clock next morning.\\nThat\\'s quick work, you know.\"\\n  \"But what do they want?\"\\n  \"Yes, that\\'s the question. Who had the house before you?\"\\n  \"A retired sea captain called Ferguson.\"\\n  \"Anything remarkable about him?\"\\n  \"Not that ever I heard of.\"\\n  \"I was wondering whether he could have buried something.\\nOf course, when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the\\nPost-Office bank. But there are always some lunatics about. It\\nwould be a dull world without them. At first I thought of some\\nburied valuable. But why, in that case, should they want your\\nfurniture? You don\\'t happen to have a Raphael or a first folio\\nShakespeare without knowing it?\"\\n  \"No, I don\\'t think I have anything rarer than a Crown Derby\\ntea-set.\"\\n  \"That would hardly justify all this mystery. Besides, why\\nshould they not openly state what they want? If they covet your\\ntea-set, they can surely offer a price for it without buying you\\nout, lock, stock, and barrel. No, as I read it, there is something\\nwhich you do not know that you have, and which you would not\\ngive up if you did know.\"\\n  \"That is how I read it,\" said I.\\n  \"Dr. Watson agrees, so that settles it.\"\\n  \"Well, Mr. Holmes, what can it be?\"\\n  \"Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get\\nit to a finer point. You have been in this house a year.\"\\n  \"Nearly two.\"\\n  \"All the better. During this long period no one wants anything\\nfrom you. Now suddenly within three or four days you have\\nurgent demands. What would you gather from that?\"\\n  \"It can only mean,\" said I, \"that the object, whatever it may\\nbe, has only just come into the house.\"\\n  \"Settled once again,\" said Holmes. \"Now, Mrs. Maberley\\nhas any object just arrived?\"\\n  \"No, I have bought nothing new this year.\"\\n  \"Indeed! That is very remarkable. Well, I think we had best\\nlet matters develop a little further until we have clearer data. Is\\nthat lawyer of yours a capable man?\"\\n  \"Mr. Sutro is most capable.\"\\n  \"Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan, who has just\\nbanged your front door alone?\"\\n  \"I have a young girl.\"\\n  \"Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house. You\\nmight possibly want protection.\"\\n  \"Against whom?\"\\n  \"Who knows? The matter is certainly obscure. If I can\\'t find\\nwhat they are after, I must approach the matter from the other\\nend and try to get at the principal. Did this house-agent man give\\nany address?\"\\n  \"Simply his card and occupation. Haines-Johnson, Auctioneer\\nand Valuer.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t think we shall find him in the directory. Honest\\nbusiness men don\\'t conceal their place of business. Well, you\\nwill let me know any fresh development. I have taken up your\\ncase, and you may rely upon it that I shall see it through.\"\\n  As we passed through the hall Holmes\\'s eyes, which missed\\nnothing, lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled\\nin a corner. The labels shone out upon them.\\n  \" \\'Milano.\\' \\'Lucerne.\\' These are from Italy.\"\\n  \"They are poor Douglas\\'s things.\"\\n  \"You have not unpacked them? How long have you had\\nthem?\"\\n  \"They arrived last week.\"\\n  \"But you said -- why, surely this might be the missing link.\\nHow do we know that there is not something of value there?\"\\n  \"There could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes. Poor Douglas had\\nonly his pay and a small annuity. What could he have of value?\"\\n  Holmes was lost in thought.\\n  \"Delay no longer, Mrs. Maberley,\" he said at last. \"Have\\nthese things taken upstairs to your bedroom. Examine them as\\nsoon as possible and see what they cohtain. I will come to-\\nmorrow and hear your report.\"\\n  It was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very\\nclose surveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the\\nend of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the\\nshadow. We came on him quite suddenly, and a grim and\\nmenacing figure he looked in that lonely place. Holmes clapped\\nhis hand to his pocket.\\n  \"Lookin\\' for your gun, Masser Holmes?\"\\n  \"No, for my scent-bottle, Steve.\"\\n  \"You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain\\'t you?\"\\n  \"It won\\'t be funny for you, Steve, if I get after you. I gave\\nyou fair warning this morning.\"\\n  \"Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over what you said,\\nand I don\\'t want no more talk about that affair of Masser\\nPerkins. S\\'pose I can help you, Masser Holmes, I will.\"\\n  \"Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job.\"\\n  \"So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes, I told you the truth\\nbefore. I don\\'t know. My boss Barney gives me orders and that\\'s\\nall.\"\\n  \"Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady in that house,\\nand everything under that roof, is under my protection. Don\\'t\\nforget it.\"\\n  \"All right, Masser Holmes. I\\'ll remember.\"\\n  \"I\\'ve got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, Wat-\\nson,\" Holmes remarked as we walked on. \"I think he would\\ndouble-cross his employer if he knew who he was. It was lucky I\\nhad some knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and that Steve\\nwas one of them. Now, Watson, this is a case for Langdale Pike,\\nand I am going to see him now. When I get back I may be\\nclearer in the matter.\"\\n  I saw no more of Holmes during the day, but I could well\\nimagine how he spent it, for Langdale Pike was his human\\nbook of reference upon all matters of social scandal. This\\nstrange, languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow\\nwindow of a St. James\\'s Street club and was the receiving-\\nstation as well as the transmitter for all the gossip of the\\nmetropolis. He made, it was said, a four-figure income by\\nthe paragraphs which he contributed every week to the gar-\\nbage papers which cater to an inquisitive public. If ever, far\\ndown in the turbid depths of London life, there was some\\nstrange swirl or eddy, it was marked with automatic exact-\\nness by this human dial upon the surface. Holmes discreetly\\nhelped Langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was helped in\\nturn.\\n  When I met my friend in his room early next morning, I was\\nconscious from his bearing that all was well, but none the less a\\nmost unpleasant surprise was awaiting us. It took the shape of\\nthe following telegram.\\n\\n       Please come out at once. Client\\'s house burgled in the\\n     night. Police in possession.\\n                           SUTRO.\\n  Holmes whistled. \"The drama has come to a crisis, and\\nquicker than I had expected. There is a great driving-power at\\nthe back of this business, Watson, which does not surprise me\\nafter what I have heard. This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. I\\nmade a mistake, I fear, in not asking you to spend the night on\\nguard. This fellow has clearly proved a broken reed. Well, there\\nis nothing for it but another journey to Harrow Weald.\"\\n  We found The Three Gables a very different establishment to\\nthe orderly household of the previous day. A small group of\\nidlers had assembled at the garden gate, while a couple of\\nconstables were examining the windows and the geranium beds.\\nWithin we met a gray old gentleman, who introduced himself as\\nthe lawyer together with a bustling, rubicund inspector, who\\ngreeted Hoimes as an old friend.\\n  \"Well, Mr. Holmes, no chance for you in this case, I\\'m\\nafraid. Just a common, ordinary burglary, and well within the\\ncapacity of the poor old police. No experts need apply.\"\\n  \"I am sure the case is in very good hands,\" said Holmes.\\n\"Merely a common burglary, you say?\"\\n  \"Quite so. We know pretty well who the men are and where\\nto find them. It is that gang of Barney Stockdale, with the big\\nnigger in it -- they\\'ve been seen about here.\"\\n  \"Excellent! What did they get?\"\\n  \"Well, they don\\'t seem to have got much. Mrs. Maberley was\\nchloroformed and the house was -- Ah! here is the lady herself.\"\\n  Our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered\\nthe room, leaning upon a little maidservant.\\n  \"You gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes,\" said she, smiling\\nruefully. \"Alas, I did not take it! I did not wish to trouble Mr.\\nSutro, and so I was unprotected.\"\\n  \"I only heard of it this morning,\" the lawyer explained.\\n  \"Mr. Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house. I\\nneglected his advice, and I have paid for it.\"\\n  \"You look wretchedly ill,\" said Holmes. \"Perhaps you are\\nhardly equal to telling me what occurred.\"\\n  \"It is all here,\" said the inspector, tapping a bulky notebook.\\n  \"Still, if the lady is not too exhausted --\"\\n  \"There is really so little to tell. I have no doubt that wicked\\nSusan had planned an entrance for them. They must have known\\nthe house to an inch. I was conscious for a moment of the\\nchloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but I have no\\nnotion how long I may have been senseless. When I woke, one\\nman was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in\\nhis hand from among my son\\'s baggage, which was partially\\nopened and littered over the floor. Before he could get away I\\nsprang up and seized him.\"\\n  \"You took a big risk,\" said the inspector.\\n  \"I clung to him, but he shook me off, and the other may have\\nstruck me, for I can remember no more. Mary the maid heard the\\nnoise and began screaming out of the window. That brought the\\npolice, but the rascals had got away.\"\\n  \"What did they take?\"\\n  \"Well, I don\\'t think there is anything of value missing. I am\\nsure there was nothing in my son\\'s trunks.\"\\n  \"Did the men leave no clue?\"\\n  \"There was one sheet of paper which I may have torn from\\nthe man that I grasped. It was lying all crumpled on the floor. It\\nis in my son\\'s handwriting.\"\\n  \"Which means that it is not of much use,\" said the inspector.\\n\"Now if it had been in the burglar\\'s --\"\\n  \"Exactly,\" said Holmes. \"What rugged common sense! None\\nthe less, I should be curious to see it.\"\\n  The inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his\\npocketbook.\\n  \"I never pass anything, however trifling,\" said he with some\\npomposity. \"That is my advice to you, Mr. Holmes. In twenty-\\nfive years\\' experience I have learned my lesson. There is always\\nthe chance of finger-marks or something.\"\\n  Holmes inspected the sheet of paper.\\n  \"What do you make of it, Inspector?\"\\n  \"Seems to be the end of some queer novel, so far as I can\\nsee.\"\\n  \"It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale,\" said\\nHolmes. \"You have noticed the number on the top of the page.\\nIt is two hundred and forty-five. Where are the odd two hundred\\nand forty-four pages?\"\\n  \"Well, I suppose the burglars got those. Much good may it do\\nthem!\"\\n  \"It seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal\\nsuch papers as that. Does it suggest anything to you, Inspector?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir, it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just\\ngrabbed at what came first to hand. I wish them joy of what they\\ngot.\"\\n  \"Why should they go to my son\\'s things?\" asked Mrs.\\nMaberley.\\n  \"Well, they found nothing valuable downstairs, so they tried\\ntheir luck upstairs. That is how I read it. What do you make of\\nit, Mr. Holmes?\"\\n  \"I must think it over, Inspector. Come to the window, Wat-\\nson.\" Then, as we stood together, he read over the fragment of\\npaper. It began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this:\\n\\n       \". . . face bled considerably from the cuts and blows,\\n     but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that\\n     lovely face, the face for which he had been prepared to\\n     sacrifice his very life, looking out at his agony and humilia-\\n     tion. She smiled -- yes, by Heaven! she smiled, like the\\n     heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her. It was at\\n     that moment that love died and hate was born. Man must\\n     live for something. If it is not for your embrace, my lady,\\n     then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete\\n     revenge.\"\\n\\n  \"Queer grammar!\" said Holmes with a smile as he handed the\\npaper back to the inspector. \"Did you notice how the \\'he\\'\\nsuddenly changed to \\'my\\'? The writer was so carried away by\\nhis own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to\\nbe the hero.\"\\n  \"It seemed mighty poor stuff,\" said the inspector as he re-\\nplaced it in his book. \"What! are you off, Mr. Holmes?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t think there is anything more for me to do now that\\nthe case is in such capable hands. By the way, Mrs. Maberley,\\ndid you say you wished to travel?\"\\n  \"It has always been my dream, Mr. Holmes.\"\\n  \"Where would you like to go -- Cairo, Madeira, the Riviera?\"\\n  \"Oh if I had the money I would go round the world.\"\\n  \"Quite so. Round the world. Well, good-morning. I may drop\\nyou a line in the evening.\" As we passed the window I caught a\\nglimpse of the inspector\\'s smile and shake of the head. \"These\\nclever fellows have always a touch of madness.\" That was what\\nI read in the inspector\\'s smile.\\n  \"Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey,\"\\nsaid Holmes when we were back in the roar of central London\\nonce more. \"I think we had best clear the matter up at once, and\\nit would be well that you should come with me, for it is safer to\\nhave a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as Isadora\\nKlein.\"\\n  We had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in\\nGrosvenor Square. Holmes had been sunk in thought, but he\\nroused himself suddenly.\\n  \"By the way, Watson, I suppose you see it all clearly?\"\\n  \"No, I can\\'t say that I do. I only gather that we are going to\\nsee the lady who is behind all this mischief.\"\\n  \"Exactly! But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to\\nyou? She was, of course, the celebrated beauty. There was never\\na woman to touch her. She is pure Spanish, the real blood of the\\nmasterfui Conquistadors, and her people have been leaders in\\nPernambuco for generations. She married the aged German sugar\\nking, Klein, and presently found herself the richest as well as the\\nmost lovely widow upon earth. Then there was an interval of\\nadventure when she pleased her own tastes. She had several\\nlovers, and Douglas Maberley, one of the most striking men in\\nLondon, was one of them. It was by all accounts more than an\\nadventure with him. He was not a society butterfly but a strong,\\nproud man who gave and expected all. But she is the \\'belle dame\\nsans merci\\' of fiction. When her caprice is satisfied the matter is\\nended, and if the other party in the matter can\\'t take her word\\nfor it she knows how to bring it home to him.\"\\n  \"Then that was his own story --\"\\n  \"Ah! you are piecing it together now. I hear that she is about\\nto marry the young Duke of Lomond, who might almost be her\\nson. His Grace\\'s ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal\\nwould be a different matter, so it is imperative -- Ah! here we\\nare.\"\\n  It was one of the finest corner-houses of the West End. A\\nmachine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word\\nthat the lady was not at home. \"Then we shall wait until she is,\"\\nsaid Holmes cheerfully.\\n  The machine broke down.\\n  \"Not at home means not at home to you,\" said the footman.\\n  \"Good,\" Holmes answered. \"That means that we shall not\\nhave to wait. Kindly give this note to your mistress.\"\\n  He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook,\\nfolded it, and handed it to the man.\\n  \"What did you say, Holmes?\" I asked.\\n  \"I simply wrote: \\'Shall it be the police, then?\\' I think that\\nshould pass us in.\"\\n  It did -- with amazing celerity. A minute later we were in an\\nArabian Nights drawing-room, vast and wonderful, in a half\\ngloom, picked out with an occasional pink electric light. The\\nlady had come, I felt, to that time of life when even the proudest\\nbeauty finds the half light more welcome. She rose from a settee\\nas we entered: tall, queenly, a perfect figure, a lovely mask-like\\nface, with two wonderful Spanish eyes which looked murder at\\nus both.\\n  \"What is this intrusion -- and this insulting message?\" she\\nasked, holding up the slip of paper.\\n  \"I need not explain, madame. I have too much respect for\\nyour intelligence to do so -- though I confess that intelligence has\\nbeen surprisingly at fault of late.\"\\n  \"How so, sir?\"\\n  \"By supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from\\nmy work. Surely no man would take up my profession if it were\\nnot that danger attracts him. It was you, then, who forced me to\\nexamine the case of young Maberley.\"\\n  \"I have no idea what you are talking about. What have I to do\\nwith hired bullies?\"\\n  Holmes turned away wearily.\\n  \"Yes, I have underrated your intelligence. Well, good-after-\\nnoon!\"\\n  \"Stop! Where are you going?\"\\n  \"To Scotland Yard.\"\\n  We had not got halfway to the door before she had overtaken\\nus and was holding his arm. She had turned in a moment from\\nsteel to velvet.\\n  \"Come and sit down, gentlemen. Let us talk this matter over.\\nI feel that I may be frank with you, Mr. Holmes. You have the\\nfeelings of a gentleman. How quick a woman\\'s instinct is to find\\nit out. I will treat you as a friend.\"\\n  \"I cannot promise to reciprocate, madame. I am not the law,\\nbut I represent justice so far as my feeble powers go. I am ready\\nto listen, and then I will tell you how I will act.\"\\n  \"No doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like\\nyourself.\"\\n  \"What was really foolish, madame, is that you have placed\\nyourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or\\ngive you away.\"\\n  \"No, no! I am not so simple. Since I have promised to be\\nfrank, I may say that no one, save Barney Stockdale and Susan,\\nhis wife, have the least idea who their employer is. As to them,\\nwell, it is not the first --\" She smiled and nodded with a\\ncharming coquettish intimacy.\\n  \"l see. You\\'ve tested them before.\"\\n  \"They are good hounds who run silent.\"\\n  \"Such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand\\nthat feeds them. They will be arrested for this burglary. The\\npolice are already after them.\"\\n  \"They will take what comes to them. That is what they are\\npaid for. I shall not appear in the matter.\"\\n  \"Unless I bring you into it.\"\\n  \"No, no, you would not. You are a gentleman. It is a wom-\\nan\\'s secret.\"\\n  \"In the first place, you must give back this manuscript.\"\\n  She broke into a ripple of laughter and walked to the fireplace.\\nThere was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker.\\n\"Shall I give this back?\" she asked. So roguish and exquisite\\ndid she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that\\nI felt of all Holmes\\'s criminals this was the one whom he would\\nfind it hardest to face. However, he was immune from sentiment.\\n  \"That seals your fate,\" he said coldly. \"You are very prompt\\nin your actions, madame, but you have overdone it on this\\noccasion.\"\\n  She threw the poker down with a clatter.\\n  \"How hard you are!\" she cried. \"May I tell you the whole\\nstory?\"\\n  \"I fancy I could tell it to you.\"\\n  \"But you must look at it with my eyes, Mr. Holmes. You\\nmust realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all\\nher life\\'s ambition about to be ruined at the last moment. Is such\\na woman to be blamed if she protects herself?\"\\n  \"The original sin was yours.\"\\n  \"Yes, yes! I admit it. He was a dear boy, Douglas, but it so\\nchanced that he could not fit into my plans. He wanted marriage --\\nmarriage, Mr. Holmes -- with a penniless commoner. Nothing\\nless would serve him. Then he became pertinacious. Because I\\nhad given he seemed to think that I still must give, and to him\\nonly. It was intolerable. At last I had to make him realize it.\"\\n  \"By hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window.\"\\n  \"You do indeed seem to know everything. Well, it is true.\\nBarney and the boys drove him away, and were, I admit, a little\\nrough in doing so. But what did he do then? Could I have\\nbelieved that a gentleman would do such an act? He wrote a\\nbook in which he described his own story. I, of course, was the\\nwolf; he the lamb. It was all there, under different names, of\\ncourse; but who in all London would have failed to recognize it?\\nWhat do you say to that, Mr. Holmes?\"\\n  \"Well, he was within his rights.\"\\n  \"It was as if the air of Italy had got into his blood and brought\\nwith it the old cruel Italian spirit. He wrote to me and sent me a\\ncopy of his book that I might have the torture of anticipation.\\nThere were two copies, he said -- one for me, one for his\\npublisher.\"\\n  \"How did you know the publisher\\'s had not reached him?\"\\n  \"I knew who his publisher was. It is not his only novel, you\\nknow. I found out that he had not heard from Italy. Then came\\nDouglas\\'s sudden death. So long as that other manuscript was in\\nthe world there was no safety for me. Of course, it must be\\namong his effects, and these would be returned to his mother. I\\nset the gang at work. One of them got into the house as servant.\\nI wanted to do the thing honestly. I really and truly did. I was\\nready to buy the house and everything in it. I offered any price\\nshe cared to ask. I only tried the other way when everything else\\nhad failed. Now, Mr. Holmes, granting that I was too hard on\\nDouglas -- and, God knows, I am sorry for it! -- what else could I\\ndo with my whole future at stake?\"\\n  Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\\n  \"Well, well,\" said he, \"I suppose I shall have to compound a\\nfelony as usual. How much does it cost to go round the world in\\nfirst-class style?\"\\n  The lady stared in amazement.\\n  \"Could it be done on five thousand pounds?\"\\n  \"Well, I should think so, indeed!\"\\n  \"Very good.

You can\\'t play with\\nedged tools forever without cutting those dainty hands.\"\\n\\x1a', '                  THE THREE LITTLE PIGS\\n\\n   Once upon a time . . . there were three little pigs, who left their mummy\\nand daddy to see the world.\\n   All summer long, they roamed through the woods and over the plains,playing\\ngames and having fun. None were happier than the three little pigs, and they\\neasily made friends with everyone. Wherever they went, they were given a warm \\nwelcome, but as summer drew to a close, they realized that folk were drifting\\nback to their usual jobs, and preparing for winter. Autumn came and it began\\nto rain. The three little pigs started to feel they needed a real home. Sadly\\nthey knew that the fun was over now and they must set to work like the others,\\nor they\\'d be left in the cold and rain, with no roof over their heads. They\\ntalked about what to do, but each decided for himself. The laziest little pig\\nsaid he\\'d build a straw hut.\\n   \"It wlll only take a day,\\' he said. The others disagreed.\\n   \"It\\'s too fragile,\" they said disapprovingly, but he refused to listen. Not\\nquite so lazy, the second little pig went in search of planks of seasoned\\nwood.\\n   \"Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!\" It took him two days to nail them together. But the\\nthird little pig did not like the wooden house.\\n   \"That\\'s not the way to build a house!\" he said. \"It takes time, patience \\nand hard work to buiid a house that is strong enough to stand up to wind, \\nrain, and snow, and most of all, protect us from the wolf!\"\\n   The days went by, and the wisest little pig\\'s house took shape, brick by\\nbrick. From time to time, his brothers visited him, saying with a chuckle:\\n   \"Why are you working so hard? Why don\\'t you come and play?\" But the\\nstubborn bricklayer pig just said \"no\".\\n   \"I shall finish my house first. It must be solid and sturdy. And then I\\'ll\\ncome and play!\" he said. \"I shall not be foolish like you! For he who laughs\\nlast, laughs longest!\"\\n   It was the wisest little pig that found the tracks of a big wolf in the\\nneighbourhood.\\n   The little pigs rushed home in alarm. Along came the wolf, scowling \\nfiercely at the laziest pig\\'s straw hut.\\n   \"Come out!\" ordered the wolf, his mouth watering. I want to speak to you!\"\\n   \"I\\'d rather stay where I am!\" replied the little pig in a tiny voice.\\n   \"I\\'ll make you come out!\" growled the wolf angrily, and puffing out his\\nchest, he took a very deep breath. Then he blew wlth all his might, right onto\\nthe house. And all the straw the silly pig had heaped against some thin poles,\\nfell down in the great blast. Excited by his own cleverness, the wolf did not\\nnotice that the little pig had slithered out from underneath the heap of\\nstraw, and was dashing towards his brother\\'s wooden house. When he realized \\nthat the little pig was escaping, the wolf grew wild with rage.\\n   \"Come back!\" he roared, trying to catch the pig as he ran into the wooden \\nhouse. The other little pig greeted his brother, shaking like a leaf.\\n   \"I hope this house won\\'t fall down! Let\\'s lean against the door so he can\\'t\\nbreak in!\"\\n   Outside, the wolf could hear the little pigs\\' words. Starving as he was, at\\nthe idea of a two-course meal, he rained blows on the door.\\n   \"Open up! Open up! I only want to speak to you!\"\\n   Inside, the two brothers wept in fear and did their best to hold the door\\nfast against the blows. Then the furious wolf braced himself a new effort: he\\ndrew in a really enormous breath, and went ... WHOOOOO! The wooden house\\ncollapsed like a pack of cards.\\n   Luckily, the wisest little pig had been watching the scene from the window\\nof his own brick house, and he rapidly opened the door to his fleeing \\nbrothers. And not a moment too soon, for the wolf was already hammering \\nfuriously on the door. This time, the wolf had grave doubts. This house had a\\nmuch more solid air than the others. He blew once, he blew again and then for\\na third time. But all was in vain. For the house did not budge an lnch. The\\nthree little pigs watched him and their fear began to fade. Quite exhausted by\\nhis efforts, the wolf decided to try one of his tricks. He scrambled up a\\nnearby ladder, on to the roof to have a look at the chimney. However, the\\nwisest little pig had seen thls ploy, and he quickly said:\\n   \"Quick! Light the fire!\" With his long legs thrust down the chimney, the\\nwolf was not sure if he should slide down the black hole. It wouldn\\'tbe easy\\nto get in, but the sound of the little pigs\\' voices below only made him feel\\nhungrier.\\n   \"I\\'m dying of hunger! I\\'m goin to try and get down.\" And he let himself \\ndrop. But landing was rather hot, too hot! The wolf landed in the fire, stunned\\nby his fall.\\n   The flames licked his hairy coat and his tail became a flaring torch.\\n   \"Never again! Never again will I go down a chimneyl\" he squealed, as he\\ntried to put out the flames in his tail. Then he ran away as fast as he could.\\n   The three happy little pigs, dancing round and round the yard, began to \\nsing:\\n   \"Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la! The wicked black wolf will never come back...!\"\\n   From that terrible day on, the wisest little pig\\'s brothers set to work\\nwith a will. In less than no time, up went the two new brick houses. The wolf\\ndid return once to roam in the neighbourhood, but when he caught sight of\\nthree chimneys, he remembered the terrible pain of a burnt tail, and he left\\nfor good.\\n   Now safe and happy, the wisest little pig called to his brothers:\\n   \"No more work! Come on, let\\'s go and play!\"\\n', \"\\nDate:  03-09-89  20:46\\nFrom:  Staeorra Rokraven\\n\\n\\n     THE CLOUD SCULPTORS\\n\\n     -\\n\\n  The air finds flight in forms of lofty wind\\n\\n  As one with nature's children taking part\\n\\n  And soaring up to go and find a friend\\n\\n  Then join with water spinning wispy art.\\n\\n     -\\n\\n  This nature's process has eternal known\\n\\n  The way to hang up on the sky these drapes\\n\\n  But wonder not how these soft clouds have grown\\n\\n  From fleecy strand filled webs to take their shapes?\\n\\n     -\\n\\n  Perhaps the artist's brush a thing unseen\\n\\n  With living tools the Elder Gods express\\n\\n  Those firey ones whose scales and talons gleam\\n\\n  To grace the heavens with their soft caress.\\n\\n     -\\n\\n    Now see the strokes of carving wings along\\n\\n    With falling rain - the strains of Dragon song.\\n\\n     -----     9 March 1989     -----\\n\\n\\n\\n     A DREAMING DESIRE\\n\\n     -\\n\\n  A spark comes coiling to the edge of sleep\\n\\n  From realms arcane which have become unknown\\n\\n  And from this psychic well does beauty leap\\n\\n  A vision cherished for to call my own.\\n\\n     -\\n\\n  This wispy strand now takes it's shape in fire\\n\\n  And fueled by sources boldly to enchant\\n\\n  Then forming curves from wish of heart's desire\\n\\n  A Woman's eyes all graced with Elvish slant.\\n\\n     -\\n\\n  The shield maid's arms then reach and wanting clasp\\n\\n  We intertwine within her streaming hair\\n\\n  Then sighing voices send a heartfelt gasp\\n\\n  As fragrance heralds tawny skin now bare'd.\\n\\n     -\\n\\n    This honored Lady may in shadows walk\\n\\n    But fate may someday find my heart unlock.\\n\\n     -----     9 March 1989     -----\\n\\n\\n\\n     TO THE BONFIRES\\n\\n     -\\n\\n  A circle gathered round a roaring pit\\n\\n  All joining hands to bask within it's glow\\n\\n  And under Moon crowned sky all starry lit\\n\\n  We sing and praise the Power's shadowed flow.\\n\\n     -\\n\\n  For some the flames form dancing Dragon's wing\\n\\n  And other smoke wrought visions climb the air\\n\\n  For all a caring closeness will this bring\\n\\n  And psychic current bonding hearts to share.\\n\\n     -\\n\\n  We charge this timeless place between the worlds\\n\\n  To call the Goddess' love within our hearts\\n\\n  And join with her our joyous souls unfurled\\n\\n  Our spirits dance with her by ancient arts.\\n\\n     -\\n\\n    This night forever captured in this glade\\n\\n    To see old souls re-met and friendships made.\\n\\n     -----     9 March 1989     -----\\n\\n          -  J.A.

It will be obvious that any details\\nwhich would help the reader exactly to identify the college or the\\ncriminal would be injudicious and offensive. So painful a scan-\\ndal may well be allowed to die out. With due discretion the\\nincident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to\\nillustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was re-\\nmarkable. I will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms\\nas would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give\\na clue as to the people concerned.\\n  We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a\\nlibrary where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious\\nresearches in early English charters -- researches which led to\\nresults so striking that they may be the subject of one of my\\nfuture narratives. Here it was that one evening we received a\\nvisit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton Soames, tutor and lec-\\nturer at the College of St. Luke\\'s. Mr. Soames was a tall, spare\\nman, of a nervous and excitable temperament. I had always\\nknown him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular\\noccasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it\\nwas clear something very unusual had occurred.\\n  \"I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of\\nyour valuable time. We have had a very painful incident at St.\\nLuke\\'s, and really, but for the happy chance of your being in\\ntown, I should have been at a loss what to do.\"\\n  \"I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions,\" my\\nfriend answered. \"I should much prefer that you called in the aid\\nof the police.\"\\n  \"No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible.\\nWhen once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this\\nis just one of those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is\\nmost essential to avoid scandal. Your discretion is as well known\\nas your powers, and you are the one man in the world who can\\nhelp me. I beg you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you can.\"\\n  My friend\\'s temper had not improved since he had been\\ndeprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street. Without\\nhis scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was\\nan uncomfortable man. He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious\\nacquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much\\nexcitable gesticulation poured forth his story.\\n  \"I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the\\nfirst day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am\\none of the examiners. My subject is Greek, and the first of the\\npapers consists of a large passage of Greek translation which the\\ncandidate has not seen. This passage is printed on the examina-\\ntion paper, and it would naturally be an immense advantage if\\nthe candidate could prepare it in advance. For this reason, great\\ncare is taken to keep the paper secret.\\n  \"To-day, about three o\\'clock, the proofs of this paper arrived\\nfrom the printers. The exercise consists of half a chapter of\\nThucydides. I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be\\nabsolutely correct. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed.\\nI had, however, promised to take tea in a friend\\'s rooms, so I\\nleft the proof upon my desk. I was absent rather more than an\\nhour.\\n  \"You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are\\ndouble -- a green baize one within and a heavy oak one without.\\nAs I approached my outer door, I was amazed to see a key in it.\\nFor an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on\\nfeeling in my pocket I found that it was all right. The only\\nduplicate which existed, so far as I knew, was that which\\nbelonged to my servant, Bannister -- a man who has looked after\\nmy room for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above\\nsuspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that he had\\nentered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very\\ncarelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to\\nmy room must have been within a very few minutes of my\\nleaving it. His forgetfulness about the key would have mattered\\nlittle upon any other occasion, but on this one day it has pro-\\nduced the most deplorable consequences.\\n  \"The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone\\nhad rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long\\nslips. I had left them all together. Now, I found that one of them\\nwas lying on the floor, one was on the side table near the\\nwindow, and the third was where I had left it.\"\\n  Holmes stirred for the first time.\\n  \"The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the\\nthird where you left it,\" said he.\\n  \"Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possi-\\nbly know that?\"\\n  \"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\"\\n  \"For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpar-\\ndonable liberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however,\\nwith the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was\\nspeaking the truth. The alternative was that someone passing had\\nobserved the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had\\nentered to look at the papers. A large sum of money is at stake,\\nfor the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous\\nman might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage\\nover his fellows.\\n  \"Bannister was very much upset by the incident. He had\\nnearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly\\nbeen tampered with. I gave him a little brandy and left him\\ncollapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of\\nthe room. I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his\\npresence besides the rumpled papers. On the table in the window\\nwere several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened. A\\nbroken tip of lead was lying there also. Evidently the rascal had\\ncopied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had\\nbeen compelled to put a fresh point to it.\"\\n  \"Excellent!\" said Holmes, who was recovering his good-\\nhumour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.\\n\"Fortune has been your friend.\"\\n  \"This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine\\nsurface of red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannis-\\nter, that it was smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in\\nit about three inches long -- not a mere scratch, but a positive cut.\\nNot only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black\\ndough or clay, with specks of something which looks like saw-\\ndust in it. I am convinced that these marks were left by the man\\nwho rifled the papers. There were no footmarks and no other\\nevidence as to his identity. I was at my wit\\'s end, when suddenly\\nthe happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and\\nI came straight round to put the matter into your hands. Do help\\nme, Mr. Holmes. You see my dilemma. Either I must find the\\nman or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers\\nare prepared, and since this cannot be done without explanation,\\nthere will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not\\nonly on the college, but on the university. Above all things, I\\ndesire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.\"\\n  \"I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice\\nas I can,\" said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat.\\n\"The case is not entirely devoid of interest. Had anyone visited\\nyou in your room after the papers came to you?\"\\n  \"Yes, young Daulat Ras, an Indian student, who lives on the\\nsame stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the exami-\\nnation.\"\\n  \"For which he was entered?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"And the papers were on your table?\"\\n  \"To the best of my belief, they were rolled up.\"\\n  \"But might be recognized as proofs?\"\\n  \"Possibly.\"\\n  \"No one else in your room?\"\\n  \"No.\"\\n  \"Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?\"\\n  \"No one save the printer.\"\\n  \"Did this man Bannister know?\"\\n  \"No, certainly not. No one knew.\"\\n  \"Where is Bannister now?\"\\n  \"He was very ill, poor fellow. I left him collapsed in the\\nchair. I was in such a hurry to come to you.\"\\n  \"You left your door open?\"\\n  \"I locked up the papers first.\"\\n  \"Then it amounts to this, Mr. Soames: that, unless the Indian\\nstudent recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tam-\\npered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing\\nthat they were there.\"\\n  \"So it seems to me.\"\\n  Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.\\n  \"Well,\" said he. \"let us go round. Not one of your cases.\\nWatson -- mental, not physical. All right; come if you want to.\\nNow, Mr. Soames -- at your disposal!\"\\n  The sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed\\nwindow on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college.\\nA Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase. On the\\nground floor was the tutor\\'s room. Above were three students,\\none on each story. It was already twilight when we reached the\\nscene of our problem. Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the\\nwindow. Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his\\nneck craned, he looked into the room.\\n  \"He must have entered through the door. There is no opening\\nexcept the one pane,\" said our learned guide.\\n  \"Dear me!\" said Holmes, and he smiled in a singular way as\\nhe glanced at our companion. \"Well, if there is nothing to be\\nlearned here, we had best go inside.\"\\n  The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his\\nroom. We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examina-\\ntion of the carpet.\\n  \"I am afraid there are no signs here,\" said he. \"One could\\nhardly hope for any upon so dry a day. Your servant seems to\\nhave quite recovered. You left him in a chair, you say. Which\\nchair?\"\\n  \"By the window there.\"\\n  \"I see. Near this little table. You can come in now. I have\\nfinished with the carpet. Let us take the little table first. Of\\ncourse, what has happened is very clear. The man entered and\\ntook the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table. He\\ncarried them over to the window table, because from there he\\ncould see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect\\nan escape.\"\\n  \"As a matter of fact, he could not,\" said Soames, \"for I\\nentered by the side door.\"\\n  \"Ah, that\\'s good! Well, anyhow, that was in his mind. Let\\nme see the three strips. No finger impressions -- no! Well he\\ncarried over this one first, and he copied it. How long wouid it\\ntake him to do that, using every possible contraction? A quarter\\nof an hour, not less. Then he tossed it down and seized the next.\\nHe was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make\\na very hurried retreat -- very hurried, since he had not time to\\nreplace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.\\nYou were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you\\nentered the outer door?\"\\n  \"No, I can\\'t say I was.\"\\n  \"Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and\\nhad, as you observe, to sharpen it again. This is of interest,\\nWatson. The pencil was not an ordinary one. It was above the\\nusual size, with a soft lead, the outer colour was dark blue, the\\nmaker\\'s name was printed in silver lettering, and the piece\\nremaining is only about an inch and a half long. Look for such a\\npencil, Mr. Soames, and you have got your man. When I add\\nthat he possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have an\\nadditional aid.\"\\n  Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of\\ninformation. \"I can follow the other points,\" said he, \"but\\nreally, in this matter of the length --\"\\n  Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space\\nof clear wood after them.\\n  \"You see?\"\\n  \"No, I fear that even now --\"\\n  \"Watson, I have always done you an injustice. There are\\nothers. What could this NN be? It is at the end of a word. You\\nare aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker\\'s name.\\nIs it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as\\nusually follows the Johann?\" He held the small table sideways to\\nthe electric light. \"I was hoping that if the paper on which he\\nwrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this\\npolished surface. No, I see nothing. I don\\'t think there is any-\\nthing more to be learned here. Now for the central table. This\\nsmall pellet is, I presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of.\\nRoughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As\\nyou say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. Dear me, this\\nis very interesting. And the cut -- a positive tear, I see. It began\\nwith a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. I am much\\nindebted to you for directing my attention to this case, Mr.\\nSoames. Where does that door lead to?\"\\n  \"To my bedroom.\"\\n  \"Have you been in it since your adventure?\"\\n  \"No, I came straight away for you.\"\\n  \"I should like to have a glance round. What a charming,\\nold-fashioned room! Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute, until\\nI have examined the floor. No, I see nothing. What about this\\ncurtain? You hang your clothes behind it. If anyone were forced\\nto conceal himself in this room he must do it there, since the bed\\nis too low and the wardrobe too shallow. No one there, I\\nsuppose?\"\\n  As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little\\nrigidity and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an\\nemergency. As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed\\nnothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of\\npegs. Holmes turned away, and stooped suddenly to the floor.\\n  \"Halloa! What\\'s this?\" said he.\\n  It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like\\nthe one upon the table of the study. Holmes held it out on his\\nopen palm in the glare of the electric light.\\n  \"Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as\\nwell as in your sitting-room, Mr. Soames.\"\\n  \"What could he have wanted there?\"\\n  \"I think it is clear enough. You came back by an unexpected\\nway, and so he had no warning until you were at the very door.\\nWhat could he do? He caught up everything which would betray\\nhim, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.\"\\n  \"Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all\\nthe time I was talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man\\nprisoner if we had only known it?\"\\n  \"So I read it.\"\\n  \"Surely there is another alternative, Mr. Holmes. I don\\'t\\nknow whether you observed my bedroom window?\"\\n  \"Lattice-paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one\\nswinging on hinge, and large enough to admit a man.\"\\n  \"Exactly. And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as\\nto be partly invisible. The man might have effected his entrance\\nthere, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally,\\nfinding the door open, have escaped that way.\"\\n  Holmes shook his head impatiently.\\n  \"Let us be practical,\" said he. \"I understand you to say that\\nthere are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of\\npassing your door?\"\\n  \"Yes, there are.\"\\n  \"And they are all in for this examination?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"Have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than\\nthe others?\"\\n  Soames hesitated.\\n  \"It is a very delicate question.\" said he. \"One hardly likes to\\nthrow suspicion where there are no proofs.\"\\n  \"Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the proofs.\"\\n  \"I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three\\nmcn who inhabit these rooms. The lower of the three is Gilchrist,\\na fine scholar and athletc, plays in the Rugby team and the\\ncricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and\\nthe long jump. He is a fine, manly fellow. His father was the\\nnotorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf. My\\nscholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and\\nindustrious. He will do well.\\n  \"The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras, the Indian. He\\nis a quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are. He is\\nwell up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject. He is\\nsteady and methodical.\\n  \"The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren. He is a brilliant\\nfellow when he chooses to work -- one of the brightest intellects\\nof the university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprinci-\\npled. He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first\\nyear. He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward\\nwith dread to the examination.\"\\n  \"Then it is he whom you suspect?\"\\n  \"I dare not go so far as that. But, of the three, he is perhaps the\\nleast unlikely.\"\\n  \"Exactly. Now, Mr. Soames, let us have a look at your\\nservant, Bannister.\"\\n  He was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven, grizzly-haired fel-\\nlow of fifty. He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance\\nof the quiet routine of his life. His plump face was twitching\\nwith his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.\\n  \"We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister,\" said\\nhis master.\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"I understand,\" said Holmes, \"that you left your key in the\\ndoor?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the\\nvery day when there were these papers inside?\"\\n  \"It was most unfortunate. sir. But I have occasionally done\\nthe same thing at other times.\"\\n  \"When did you enter the room?\"\\n  It was about half-past four. That is Mr. Soames\\'s tea time.\"\\n  \"How long did you stay?\"\\n  \"When I saw that he was absent. I withdrew at once.\"\\n  \"Did you look at these papers on the table?\"\\n  \"No, sir certainly not.\"\\n  \"How came you to leave the key in the door?\"\\n  \"I had the tea-tray in my hand. I thought I would come back\\nfor the key. Then I forgot.\"\\n  \"Has the outer door a spring lock?\"\\n  \"No, sir.\"\\n  \"Then it was open all the time?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"Anyone in the room could get out?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"When Mr. Soames returned and called for you, you were\\nvery much disturbed?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir. Such a thing has never happened during the many\\nyears that I have been here. I nearly fainted, sir.\"\\n  \"So I understand. Where were you when you began to feel\\nbad?\"\\n  \"Where was I, sir? Why, here, near the door.\"\\n  \"That is singular, because you sat down in that chair over\\nyonder near the corner. Why did you pass these other chairs?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t know, sir, it didn\\'t matter to me where I sat.\"\\n  \"I really don\\'t think he knew much about it, Mr. Holmes. He\\nwas looking very bad -- quite ghastly.\"\\n  \"You stayed here when your master left?\"\\n  \"Only for a minute or so. Then I locked the door and went to\\nmy room.\"\\n  \"Whom do you suspect?\"\\n  \"Oh, I would not venture to say, sir. I don\\'t believe there is\\nany gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by\\nsuch an action. No, sir, I\\'ll not believe it.\"\\n  \"Thank you, that will do,\" said Holmes. \"Oh, one more\\nword. You have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen\\nwhom you attend that anything is amiss?\"\\n  \"No, sir -- not a word.\"\\n  \"You haven\\'t seen any of them?\"\\n  \"No, sir.\"\\n  \"Very good. Now, Mr. Soames, we will take a walk in the\\nquadrangle, if you please.\"\\n  Three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering\\ngloom.\\n  \"Your three birds are all in their nests,\" said Holmes, looking\\nup. \"Halloa! What\\'s that? One of them seems restless enough.\"\\n  It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly\\nupon his blind. He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.\\n  \"I should like to have a peep at each of them,\" said Holmes.\\n\"Is it possible?\"\\n  \"No difficulty in the world,\" Soames answered. \"This set of\\nrooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for\\nvisitors to go over them. Come along, and I will personally\\nconduct you.\"\\n  \"No names, please!\" said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist\\'s\\ndoor. A tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and\\nmade us welcome when he understood our errand. There were\\nsome really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture\\nwithin. Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted\\non drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow\\none from our host, and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his\\nown. The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of\\nthe Indian -- a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us\\naskance, and was obviously glad when Holmes\\'s architectural\\nstudies had come to an end. I could not see that in either case\\nHolmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching.\\nOnly at the third did our visit prove abortive. The outer door\\nwould not open to our knock, and-nothing more substantial than\\na torrent of bad language came from behind it. \"I don\\'t care who\\nyou are. You can go to blazes!\" roared the angry voice. \"To-\\nmorrow\\'s the exam, and I won\\'t be drawn by anyone.\"\\n  \"A rude fellow,\" said our guide, flushing with anger as we\\nwithdrew down the stair. \"Of course, he did not realize that it\\nwas I who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very\\nuncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather\\nsuspicious.\"\\n  Holmes\\'s response was a curious one.\\n  \"Can you tell me his exact height?\" he asked.\\n  \"Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say. He is taller\\nthan the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist. I suppose five foot six\\nwould be about it.\"\\n  \"That is very important,\" said Holmes. \"And now, Mr.\\nSoames, I wish you good-night.\"\\n  Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay. \"Good\\ngracious, Mr. Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in\\nthis abrupt fashion! You don\\'t seem to realize the position.\\nTo-morrow is the examination. I must take some definite action\\nto-night. I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the\\npapers has been tampered with. The situation must be faced.\"\\n  \"You must leave it as it is. I shall drop round early to-morrow\\nmorning and chat the matter over. It is possible that I may be in\\na position then to indicate some course of action. Meanwhile,\\nyou change nothing -- nothing at all.\"\\n  \"Very good, Mr. Holmes.\"\\n  \"You can be perfectly easy in your mind. We shall certainly\\nfind some way out of your difficulties. I will take the black clay\\nwith me, also the pencil cuttings. Good-bye.\"\\n  When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again\\nlooked up at the windows. The Indian still paced his room. The\\nothers were invisible.\\n  \"Well, Watson, what do you think of it?\" Holmes asked, as\\nwe came out into the main street. \"Quite a little parlour game -- \\nsort of three-card trick, is it not? There are your three men. It\\nmust be one of them. You take your choice. Which is yours?\"\\n  \"The foul-mouthed fellow at the top. He is the one with the\\nworst record. And yet that Indian was a sly fellow also. Why\\nshould he be pacing his room all the time?\"\\n  \"There is nothing in that. Many men do it when they are\\ntrying to learn anything by heart.\"\\n  \"He looked at us in a queer way.\"\\n  \"So would you, if a flock of strangers came in on you when\\nyou were preparing for an examination next day, and every\\nmoment was of value. No, I see nothing in that. Pencils, too,\\nand knives -- all was satisfactory. But that fellow does puzzle\\nme.\"\\n  \"Who?\"\\n  \"Why, Bannister, the servant. What\\'s his game in the matter?\"\\n  \"He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.\"\\n  \"So he did me. That\\'s the puzzling part. Why should a\\nperfectly honest man -- Well, well, here\\'s a large stationer\\'s. We\\nshall begin our researches here.\"\\n  There were only four stationers of any consequences in the\\ntown, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid\\nhigh for a duplicate. All were agreed that one could be ordered,\\nbut that it was not a usual size of pencil, and that it was seldom\\nkept in stock. My friend did not appear to be depressed by his\\nfailure, but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation.\\n  \"No good, my dear Watson. This, the best and only final\\nclue, has run to nothing. But, indeed, I have little doubt that we\\ncan build up a sufficient case without it. By Jove! my dear\\nfellow, it is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green peas\\nat seven-thirty. What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and\\nyour irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to\\nquit, and that I shall share your downfall -- not, however, before\\nwe have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless\\nservant, and the three enterprising students.\"\\n  Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though\\nhe sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner. At\\neight in the morning, he came into my room just as I finished my\\ntoilet.\\n  \"Well, Watson,\" said he, \"it is time we went down to St.\\nLuke\\'s. Can you do without breakfast?\"\\n  \"Certainly.\"\\n  \"Soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell\\nhim something positive.\"\\n  \"Have you anything positive to tell him?\"\\n  \"I think so.\"\\n  \"You have formed a conclusion?\"\\n  \"Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery.\"\\n  \"But what fresh evidence could you have got?\"\\n  \"Aha! It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of\\nbed at the untimely hour of six. I have put in two hours\\' hard\\nwork and covered at least five miles, with something to show for\\nit. Look at that!\"\\n  He held out his hand. On the palm were three little pyramids\\nof black, doughy clay.\\n  \"Why, Holmes, you had only two yesterday.\"\\n  \"And one more this morning. It is a fair argument that\\nwherever No. 3 came from is also the source of Nos. 1 and 2.\\nEh, Watson? Well, come along and put friend Soames out of his\\npain.\"\\n  The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agita-\\ntion when we found him in his chambers. In a few hours the\\nexamination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma\\nbetween making the facts public and allowing the culprit to\\ncompete for the valuable scholarship. He could hardly stand still,\\nso great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes\\nwith two eager hands outstretched.\\n  \"Thank heaven that you have come! I feared that you had\\ngiven it up in despair. What am I to do? Shall the examination\\nproceed?\"\\n  \"Yes, let it proceed, by all means.\"\\n  \"But this rascal?\"\\n  \"He shall not compete.\"\\n  \"You know him?\"\\n  \"I think so. If this matter is not to become public. we must\\ngive ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small\\nprivate court-martial. You there, if you please, Soames! Watson\\nyou here! I\\'ll take the armchair in the middle. I think that we are\\nnow sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast.\\nKindly ring the bell!\"\\n  Bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear\\nat our judicial appearance.\\n  \"You will kindly close the door,\" said Holmes. \"Now\\nBannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday\\'s\\nincident.\\'\\n  The man turned white to the roots of his hair.\\n  \"I have told you everything, sir.\"\\n  \"Nothing to add?\"\\n  \"Nothing at all, sir.\"\\n  \"Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you. When you\\nsat down on that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to\\nconceal some object which would have shown who had been in\\nthe room?\"\\n  Bannister\\'s face was ghastly.\\n  \"No, sir, certainly not.\"\\n  \"It is only a suggestion,\" said Holmes, suavely. \"I frankly\\nadmit that I am unable to prove it. But it seems probable enough\\nsince the moment that Mr. Soames\\'s back was turned, you\\nreleased the man who was hiding in that bedroom.\"\\n  Bannister licked his dry lips.\\n  \"There was no man, sir.\"\\n  \"Ah, that\\'s a pity, Bannister. Up to now you may have\\nspoken the truth, but now I know that you have lied.\"\\n  The man\\'s face set in sullen defiance.\\n  \"There was no man, sir.\"\\n  \"Come, come, Bannister!\"\\n  \"No, sir, there was no one.\"\\n  \"In that case, you can give us no further information. Would\\nyou please remain in the room? Stand over there near the bed-\\nroom door. Now, Soames, I am going to ask you to have the\\ngreat kindness to go up to the room of young Gilchrist. and to\\nask him to step down into yours.\"\\n  An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the\\nstudent. He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with\\na springy step and a pleasant, open face. His troubled blue eyes\\nglanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of\\nblank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.\\n  \"Just close the door,\" said Holmes. \"Now, Mr. Gilchrist, we\\nare all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of\\nwhat passes between us. We can be perfectly frank with each\\nother. We want to know, Mr. Gilchrist, how you, an honourable\\nman, ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday?\"\\n  The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look\\nfull of horror and reproach at Bannister.\\n  \"No, no, Mr. Gilchrist, sir, I never said a word -- never one\\nword!\" cried the servant.\\n  \"No, but you have now,\" said Holmes. \"Now, sir, you must\\nsee that after Bannister\\'s words your position is hopeless, and\\nthat your only chance lies in a frank confession.\"\\n  For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control\\nhis writhing features. The next he had thrown himself on his\\nknees beside the table, and burying his face in his hands, he had\\nburst into a storm of passionate sobbing.\\n  \"Come, come,\" said Holmes, kindly, \"it is human to err,\\nand at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.\\nPerhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell Mr. Soames\\nwhat occurred, and you can check me where I am wrong. Shall I\\ndo so? Well, well, don\\'t trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I\\ndo you no injustice.\\n  \"From the moment, Mr. Soames, that you said to me that no\\none, not even Bannister, could have told that the papers were in\\nyour room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind.\\nThe printer one could, of course, dismiss. He could examine the\\npapers in his own office. The Indian I also thought nothing of. If\\nthe proofs were in a roll, he could not possibly know what they\\nwere. On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence\\nthat a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on\\nthat very day the papers were on the table. I dismissed that. The\\nman who entered knew that the papers were there. How did he\\nknow?\\n  \"When I approached your room, I examined the window. You\\namused me by supposing that I was contemplating the possibility\\nof someone having in broad daylight, under the eyes of all these\\nopposite rooms, forced himself through it. Such an idea was\\nabsurd. I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in\\norder to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table.\\nI am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less\\nthan that would have a chance. Already you see I had reason to\\nthink that, if one of your three students was a man of unusual\\nheight, he was the most worth watching of the three.\\n  \"I entered, and I took you into my confidencc as to the\\nsuggestions of the side table. Of the centre table I could make\\nnothing, until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that\\nhe was a long-distance jumper. Then the whole thing came to me\\nin an instant, and I only needed certain corroborative proofs,\\nwhich I speedily obtained.\\n  \"What happened was this: This young fellow had employed\\nhis afternoon at the athletic grounds, where he had been practis-\\ning the jump. He returned carrying his jumping-shoes, which are\\nprovided, as you are aware, with several sharp spikes. As he\\npassed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these\\nproofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were. No\\nharm would have been done had it not been that, as he passed\\nyour door, he perceived the key which had been left by the\\ncarelessness of your servant. A sudden impulse came over him to\\nenter, and see if they were indeed the proofs. It was not a\\ndangerous exploit, for he could always pretend that he had simply\\nlooked in to ask a question.\\n  \"Well, when he saw that they were indeed the proofs, it was\\nthen that he yielded to temptation. He put his shoes on the table.\\nWhat was it you put on that chair near the window?\"\\n  \"Gloves,\" said the young man.\\n  Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. \"He put his gloves\\non the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy\\nthem. He thought the tutor must return by the main gate, and that\\nhe would see him. As we know, he came back by the side gate.\\nSuddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible\\nescape. He forgot his gloves, but he caught up his shoes and\\ndarted into the bedroom. You observe that the scratch on that\\ntable is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the\\nbedroom door. That in itself is enough to show us that the shoe\\nhad been drawn in that direction, and that the culprit had taken\\nrefuge there. The earth round the spike had been left on the\\ntable, and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bed-\\nroom. I may add that I walked out to the athletic grounds this\\nmorning, saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-\\npit, and carried away a specimen of it, together with some of the\\nfine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete\\nfrom slipping. Have I told the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?\"\\n  The student had drawn himself erect.\\n  \"Yes, sir, it is true,\" said he.\\n  \"Good heavens! have you nothing to add?\" cried Soames.\\n  \"Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure\\nhas bewildered me. I have a letter here, Mr. Soames, which I\\nwrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night.\\nIt was before I knew that my sin had found me out. Here it is,\\nsir. You will see that I have said, \\'I have determined not to go\\nin for the examination. I have been offered a commission in\\nthe Rhodesian Police, and I am going out to South Africa at\\nonce.\\' \"\\n  \"I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit\\nby your unfair advantage,\" said Soames. \"But why did you\\nchange your purpose?\"\\n  Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.\\n  \"There is the man who set me in the right path,\" said he.\\n  \"Come now, Bannister,\" said Holmes. \"It will be clear to\\nyou, from what I have said, that only you could have let this\\nyoung man out, since you were left in the room, and must have\\nlocked the door when you went out. As to his escaping by that\\nwindow, it was incredible. Can you not clear up the last point in\\nthis mystery, and tell us the reasons for your action?\"\\n  \"It was simple enough, sir, if you only had known, but, with\\nall your cleverness, it was impossible that you could know. Time\\nwas, sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young\\ngentleman\\'s father. When he was ruined I came to the college as\\nservant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was\\ndown in the world. I watched his son all I could for the sake of\\nthe old days. Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday,\\nwhen the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was Mr.\\nGilchrist\\'s tan gloves a-lying in that chair. I knew those gloves\\nwell, and I understood their message. If Mr. Soames saw them,\\nthe game was up. I flopped down into that chair, and nothing\\nwould budge me until Mr. Soames went for you. Then out came\\nmy poor young master, whom I had dandled on my knee, and\\nconfessed it all to me. Wasn\\'t it natural, sir, that I should save\\nhim, and wasn\\'t it natural also that I should try to speak to him\\nas his dead father would have done, and make him understand\\nthat he could not profit by such a deed? Could you blame me,\\nsir?\"\\n  \"No, indeed,\" said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet.\\n  \"Well, Soames, I think we have cleared your little problem up,\\nand our breakfast awaits us at home. Come, Watson! As to you,\\nsir, I trust that a bright future awaits you in Rhodesia. For once\\nyou have fallen low. Let us see, in the future, how high you can\\nrise.\"\\n\\x1a', '                     THE THREE WISHES\\n\\n   Once upon a time . . . a woodcutter lived happily with his wife in a pretty\\nlittle log cabin in the middle of a thick forest. Each morning he set off \\nsinging to work, and when he came home in the evening, a plate of hot steaming \\nsoup was always waiting for him. \\n   One day, however, he had a strange surprise. He came upon a big fir tree \\nwith strange open holes on the trunk. It looked somehow different from the \\nother trees, and just as he was about to chop it down, the alarmed face of an \\nelf popped out of a hole.\\n   \"What\\'s all this banging?\" asked the elf. \"You\\'re not thinking of cutting \\ndown this tree, are you? It\\'s my home. I live here!\" The woodcutter dropped \\nhis axe in astonlshment.\\n   \"Well, I . . .\" he stammered.\\n   \"With all the other trees there are in this forest, you have to pick this \\none. Lucky I was in, or I would have found myself homeless.\"\\n   Taken aback at these words, the woodcutter qulckly recovered, for after all\\nthe elf was quite tiny, while he himself was a big hefty chap, and he boldly \\nreplied: \"I\\'ll cut down any tree I like, so . . .\" \\n   \"All right! All right!\" broke in the elf. \"Shall we put it this way: if you\\ndon\\'t cut down this tree, I grant you three wishes. Agreed?\" The woodcutter \\nscratched his head. \\n   \"Three wishes, you say? Yes, I agree.\" And he began to hack at another \\ntree. As he worked and sweated at his task, the woodcutter kept thinking about\\nthe magic wishes. \\n   \"I\\'ll see what my wife thinks...\"\\n   The woodcutter\\'s wife was busily cleaning a pot outside the house when her \\nhusband arrived. Grabbing her round the waist, he twirled her in delight.\\n   \"Hooray! Hooray! Our luck is in!\" \\n   The woman could not understand why her husband was so pleased with himself \\nand she shrugged herself free. Later, however, over a glass of fine wine at \\nthe table, the woodcutter told his wife of his meeting with the elf, and she \\ntoo began to picture the wonderful things that the elf\\'s three wishes might \\ngive them. The woodcutter\\'s wife took a first sip of wine from her husband\\'s \\nglass.\\n   \"Nice,\" she said, smacking her lips. \"I wish I had a string of sausages to \\ngo with it, though...\"\\n   Instantly she bit her tongue, but too late. Out of the air appeared the \\nsausages while the woodcutter stuttered with rage.\\n   \". . . what have you done! Sausages . . . What a stupid waste of a wish! \\nYou foollsh woman. I wish they would stick up your nose!\" No sooner sald than\\ndone. For the sausages leapt up and stuck fast to the end of the woman\\'s nose.\\nThis time, the woodcutter\\'s wife flew into a rage.\\n   \"You idiot, what have you done? With all the things we could have wished \\nfor . . .\" The mortified woodcutter, who had just repeated his wife\\'s own \\nmistake, exclaimed:\\n   \"I\\'d chop . . .\" Luckily he stopped himself in time, realizing with horror \\nthat he\\'d been on the point of having his tongue chopped off. As his wife \\ncomplained and blamed him, the poor man burst out laughing.\\n   \"If only you knew how funny you look with those sausages on the end of your\\nnose!\" Now that really upset the woodcutter\\'s wife. She hadn\\'t thought of her \\nlooks. She tried to tug away the sausages but they would not budge. She pulled \\nagain and again, but in vain. The sausages were firmly attached to her nose. \\nTerrified, she exclaimed: \"They\\'ll be there for the rest of my life!\"\\n   Feeling sorry for his wife and wondering how he could ever put up with a \\nwoman with such an awkward nose, the woodcutter said: \"I\\'ll try.\" Grasping the\\nstring of sausages, he tugged with all his might. But he simply pulled his \\nwife over on top of him. The pair sat on the floor, gazing sadly at each other.\\n   \"What shall we do now?\" they said, each thinking the same thought.\\n   \"There\\'s only one thing we can do . . .\" ventured the woodcutter\\'s wife \\ntimidly.\\n   \"Yes, I\\'m afraid so . . .\" her husband sighed, remembering their dreams of \\nriches, and he bravely wished the third and last wish \"I wish the sausages \\nwould leave my wife\\'s nose.\"\\n   And they did. Instantly, husband and wife hugged each other tearfully, \\nsaying \"Maybe we\\'ll be poor, but we\\'ll be happy again!\"\\n   That evening, the only reminder of the woodcutter\\'s meeting with the elf \\nwas the string of sausages. So the couple fried them, gloomily thinking of \\nwhat that meal had cost them.\\n', '                       Four Moons of Death\\n\\n        DING DONG! The melancholy tintinabulation of the iron bells echoed\\nin the golden town of Arno. The shuffling of feet filing out of a granite\\ncathedral and the murmuring voices of paupers dominated all the sound.\\nResiding peacefully at it\\'s zenith in it\\'s aquamarine abode was the ocher\\nsun.\\n        A slight breeze whipped up some dead leaves from the tan soil\\nrevealing some rustling. Slender and have brown hair, a man dressed in a\\nwhite robe with some golden lace entered Al\\'s Pub.\\n        As he entered the bar, tattooed, bearded, deep-voiced men sat at\\ntables, discussing about their adventures and their treasures while\\nslurping various alcoholic beverages.\\n        Greetings came from every person as the Arch Bishop sauntered\\ntowards an empty table. He received all sorts of messages like :\\n\"Good afternoon Fleric. How are thee today? I absolutely believe in all\\nthy sermons.\"\\n        Al paced up to the waxed oak table as Fleric stood his wooden\\ncudgel next to his worn-out stool.\\n        \"What will it be Fleric?\"\\n        \"I shalt have some boar meat and a cup of thy finest wine\"\\n        \"Very good selection. Thy cost will be 5000 copper pieces, Fleric\"\\n        Willfully, Fleric placed 5 platinum coins engraved with the quote\\n\"In Annisette We Trust\" on the polished table. Al gratefully grinned as he\\nscooped up the money and briskly walked-off jingling them in his enclosed\\nhands.\\n        Fleric slipped a small, ancient tome from his robe\\'s long sleeve.\\nHe flipped the yellow pages to the chapter on the 4 moons. Fleric\\'s eyes\\ncaught something that made his gray matter go to work.\\n        The inscription on the crinkled paper read: \"When the 4 moons are\\nfull, it shall raise the deceased. If thou even look at any grave during\\nthat period, thou shalt meet thy untimely demise.\"  His almost hollow jaw\\ndrooped. \"Tonight is the night when all 4 moons ARE full.\" Fleric thought.\\n\" I must warn everyone.\" His thin arm motioned at a brown haired woman who\\nheld a mahogany lute. Her cotton clothes seemed oversized and a red silk\\nhat topped her scalp.\\n        \"Why hello Fleric. What do thou want with a wandering minstreal\\nlike me? Surely thou must have better things to do than talking to a\\npeasent like me.\"\\n        \"Warn everyone that tonight all 4 moons are full. That is all I\\nwant from thee, madame.\" Suddenly, time stood still as all the gossiping\\nand shouting terminated. Surprised eyes fixed themselves at Fleric. Without\\nhesitating, all the customers fled the vicinity whispering to each other.\\n        \"I do not think that will be necessary Fleric. Everyone else should\\nknow it by now.\" the woman replies. With that, she walks up to Al and\\nstarted strumming on her lute a song of praise to the goddess Annisette.\\n        Heaving a great sigh, Fleric continued to peruse the tiny book :\\n\"For thou to understand more, thou must understand how the moons behave.\\nFlit, Pop and Lag go from east to west, but Instanity flies across the\\nsky the other way. Flit is fast and Lag is slow in it\\'s orbit. Pop is the\\nstrangest of all the moons. It can appear any time and anywhere at night.\\nBecause of these behaviors, the gravity of the moons mix itself with\\nthe radiation from the sun, creating a dark rainbow. This unseen matter\\nstimulates evil and will raise the dead.\"\\n        Al\\'s stout and jolly body loomed over Fleric as some food was\\nsituated beside the Arch Bishop. Fleric\\'s lunch smelled good. The odor\\ngrabbed Fleric\\'s bony hand and dragged it towards the cup of Brandy.\\nStill staring at the book, Fleric drew the wine closer to him. His hazel\\neyes lifted from the book and rolled back as he gulped down the drink.\\n\\x0c\\nWhen he quenched his thirst, he put the bronze goblet back on the table\\nand slammed the book shut.\\n        A warrior embodied by plate armour sat on the flimsy stool on the\\nopposite side of the 4-legged wooden platform. SNAP! The stool crumpled\\ninto countless splinters. THUD! The fighter collapsed on to the dirt floor.\\n        \"Help me up Fleric\" pleaded the myrmidon. His outstretched arm\\nbeckoned Fleric (who was starting to nibble on his boar meat) to lift him\\nup. The Arch Bishop threw down the slab of meat and yanked the man off of\\nthe floor with greasy hands.\\n        \"Thank you Fleric\"\\n        \"Do not mention it Boris.\"\\n        \"Guess what.\"\\n        \"What?\"\\n        \"We have a mission to fulfill.\"\\n        \"WE?!?!?\"\\n        \"Yes, we must rescue 5 children who wandered off towards the Graves\\nof the Ones Beyond! The Duke is willing to give us 5,000,000 copper pieces.\\nLook Fleric, we will split it 50/50. Okay?\"\\n        \"Fine\" yawned Fleric.\\n        \"Do not be so blase about it. Besides, I am looking to buy some\\narmour. Particularly, a set of mythril armour. I could use some light weight\\narmour and it does cost 25,000 gold, which means I will be spending all of\\nmy reward money. After all, I want the armour to match the color of my\\nsword, X-Calibur!\". Boris drew a blue bladed double edged sword from it\\'s\\nsheath. The saber glowed with an ultramarine aura.\\n        \"I will be back. Get ready though.\" Fleric bolted out of the bar\\nwithout even getting a tooth mark on the rest of his lunch.\"\\n        \"What about thy lunch?\"\\n        \"I am not very hungry. You eat it!\" called Fleric.\\n\\n        Dashing towards his lodge far from the slums, Fleric knew he must\\nhurry, for the sun is about halfway covered by the horizon. As he ran into\\nthe house, he hung his white robe on a steel rack by the foyer. The Arch\\nBishop rushed into the Armoury. After flipping through his suits, cloaks,\\ncapes and various pieces of chain mail, he grabbed a set of extremely\\nover-sized Dragonhide Armour. The cleric then fumbled with attaching his\\nburnt-sienna leather pouch on his zinc belt on the armour.  With 2 hands,\\nFleric snapped a mythril plate on his left gauntlet. His right thumb and\\nindex finger grasped a crystal shillelagh. With everything all set, Fleric\\ntried to promenade as swiftly as possible back to the pub.\\n        The aureate hemisphere lingered over the naked swarm of maple and\\nredwood trees.\\n        His footsteps became farther apart as Flit, one of the moons became\\npalpable to the eyesight.\\n        At the bar, Boris jingled a sac full of exotic elixers, while\\ngazing out the window. His eyes almost were shut and his chin rested safely\\non his hand. Boris\\'s eyelids popped open when his auditory nerves received\\nthe words \"I\\'m ready now\".\\n        \"Aaaaah. You visited the apothecary, Boris.\" stated Fleric.\\nThe fighter\\'s head nodded and with the cleric, they treaded over the leaf\\ninfested ground toward the Graves of the Ones Beyond.\\n        The pair of warriors weaved pass the myriad of marble tombstones as\\nshrills of child laughter echoed from the direction of Garlock\\'s charnel\\nhouse. Instinctively, they tracked the noise with their weapons drawn.\\n        Then Fleric and Boris saw it. All five children were sitting\\nIndian-style on the granite roof of the crypt. Their tiny fingers flicked\\nstrange color disks into clay bowls on the other side of the stone slab.\\n        \"Hey, it is F-Fleric!\" stammered the smallest girl with rosy cheeks\\nand blonde curls.\\n        \"Good af-I mean evening children. What are thou doing way out here?\"\\n\\x0c\\n        \"This is the best place for tiddlywinks! Right Tricia?\" exclaimed\\nthe overweight boy.\\n        \"Yes it is Bubba. Where else can we find a flat surface as smooth\\nas this???\" replied the older girl.\\n        \"Come on children, we need to go home now.\" commanded Boris.\\n        \"NO! I WILL NOT GO!\" exclaimed the youngest boy with red hair.\\n        \"Yes thou are.\" Boris flexed his huge biceps and lifted the boy off\\nthe marble roof with his left hand. With the other hand he tapped Fleric\\'s\\nshoulder with the hilt of X-Calibur. The Arch Bishop turned around to see\\nthe ebony blade pointing at 3 of moons. Flit, Lag and Insanity glared with\\nbright light as though they were stars. Fleric nodded and led the parade of\\nchildren towards Arno.\\n        HOOOOOOOWLLLLLLLL! The howl of a distant wolf can be heard through\\nout the planet as Pop, the 4th moon appeared out of oblivion creating the\\ndark rainbow. Little did any know that the soil softly broke apart in a\\nnearby grave ahead of the party. A skeleton\\'s crimson hand poked out from\\nthe earth and grappled Fleric\\'s leg as they walked by. THUMP! Fleric\\nplunged to the ground, full of shock as to what had hit him.\\n        Fleric recovered from the fall and dusted off his soiled armour.\\nThe whole grisly skeleton began ascending from it\\'s grave revealing half of\\nits cranium sliced off.\\n        \"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!\" cried all 5 children in unison, who huddled behind\\nBoris.\\n        Fleric\\'s steel boots smacked the skeleton\\'s ribs as it attempted to\\nstrangle the cleric. The half rotted body disintegrated.\\n        More corpses began climbing out of their resting places as zombies,\\nghouls, skeletons and wights without a sound attacked the heroes. Even\\nghosts, specters and banshees rose out of their graves. Even inorganic\\nmaterial began creeping towards the party.\\n        Every swish from Boris\\'s X-Calibur decapitated at least one of the\\nundead, cutting down their numbers. Fleric\\'s diamond shillelagh granulated\\nevery atom of each spirit.\\n\\n        Flapping it\\'s hairy wings, a small mammal hovered around Nicky,\\nthe red-haired boy. An emerald mist was dispensed from the animal,\\ntransforming it into a dark being with a jet-black cape. The pearly white\\nfangs approahed Nicky\\'s throat. Closer and nearer it came. Nicky tried to\\nscream for assistence, yet the shock petrified every muscle in the little\\nboy\\'s body.\\n        This event was observed by Fleric just as a gargoyle threw a\\nbuffet right into the Arch Bishop\\'s intestines. Wincing in extreme pain,\\nFleric reeled back and toppled onto the grass. At this point in the\\nbattle, he saw this gruesome assault and dealt the neck-biter with a white\\nbulb. Used as a projectile, this seasoning landed right into the mouth of\\nthe creature. With a puff of blue-green smoke, the attacker decimated\\nleaving a very terrified Nicky behind.\\n        Severed wrinkled, scarred body parts flew everywhere as more\\nmonsters silently climbed out of their coffins.\\n        The marble gargoyle that struck Fleric earlier slashed it\\'s\\ncorundum claws at Boris\\'s wooden shield. The small plate easily crumpled\\nunder the relentless attacks from the living statue. X-Calibur suddenly\\nradiated with an azure blue light as Boris channeled his anger into the\\nmystical sword. With this sudden power, the myrmidon butchered the stone\\ngiant.\\n        The number one appeared in Fleric\\'s mind. He knew it was a cue sent\\nby the Goddess Annisette who heard their pleas for help. Death was\\ncertainly a reality if he goes through this plan. He must help his friends.\\n        \"REESHCENO!\" the cleric chanted. The magical incantation summoned a\\njiga-volt trail of electricity from the cosmos. The bolt fanned out,\\nvaporizing all the undead in a instant.\\n\\x0c\\n        The strain of this spell was way too much for any mere mortal\\'s\\nendurance to withstand. Heaving the greatest sigh in his entire existence\\nas a sentient on this planet caused Fleric to crumple on a grassy hillock.\\n        Every bit of undead organic debris slowly faded away until this\\ncemetary looked as if nothing ever occurred.\\n        All the children hovered over the limp body of Fleric, they slapped\\nhim, screamed and even dumped water on his face. His body still mimicked a\\ncorpse.\\n        Bruno took 2 blistered fingers and felt the Arch Bishop\\'s neck.\\n\"His pulse is still, there. The pulse somewhat slowed down dramatically.\"\\nhe thought.\\n        A cool, steady gust of wind ceased to blow the red, orange, yellow\\nand brown leaves around. For awhile it was a DEAD silence.\\n        KABOOOOM! A celestial lump of rock plummeted through the atmosphere\\nsmashing in the planet. The force of such a jolt shattered the granite roof\\nof Garlock\\'s mausoleum.\\n        \"HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!\" chuckled a mysterious voice. The chill of such\\nvoice sent shivers down everyone\\'s spines.\\n        An iron guantlet pulverized the bolted steel door.\\n        \"It can not be!\" Boris muttered.\\n        The younger girl stammered \"It is G-Garlock!\"\\n        A half decomposed wool cloak engulfed the metal covered body as it\\nstepped out of it\\'s charnel house.\\n        \"YES! I AM ALIVE ONCE AGAIN!\" bellowed the dark warrior.\\n        \"Thou are not going to be much longer, as long as I am here!\" Boris\\nanswered.\\n        \"Thou are such a fool! Surely thou must know that I am omnipotent!\\nNothing can stop me! Weapons can never penetrate my eclipse armour!\" At\\nGarlock\\'s words Boris thrusted the ebony sowrd into his adversary. The dark\\nwarrior wasn\\'t even slightly incapacitated.\\n        \"HA!HA! Even X-Calibur cannot damage someone who can become\\nintangible at will! Thanks to my armour!\"\\n\\n        \"If we had the right potion, maybe we can awake Fleric\" thought\\nJeff, the biggest boy. \"BRUNO! WE NEED A HEAL FLASK!\" The fighter nodded\\nwhile nimbly dodging bone-shattering jabs and uppercuts. As his hand\\nreached into his bag, his hand completely smothered an elixer covered with\\na rough surface.\\n        Jeff boldy ran up to Boris to receive the flask. He tossed it to\\nBubba who quickly dumped the purple liquid into Fleric\\'s mouth...\\n\\n        Garlock raised his gloved hand and a lump of soil popped up,\\nslipping Boris. The fingers of Garlock locked together as he pounded at\\nBoris. The myrmidon rolled awat as the dark warrior\\'s fist missed and\\npenetrated 4 feet of rocky soil.\\n        \"Thou are such a feisty little fool! I shalt personally end thy\\npathetic existence!\"\\n        Bruno managed to stand up. His plate armour, gashed, dented,\\nscraped and cracked crumpled, leaving a studded leather suit.\\n        ZAP! Two projections of electrically charged photons flew at Boris.\\nWhack! Whack! Like a baseball player (the game does not exist yet), Boris\\nswung X-Calibur at the blasts. They dissapated at the contact with the\\nebony blade.\\n        Fleric\\'s eyes flashed open as he saw Boris reeling back and\\ncrashing into a marble statue of a headless angel (actually it wasn\\'t\\nheadless before).\\n        \"He\\'s awake!\" cried the 2 girls.\\n        Garlock\\'s featureless titanium mask faced the cleric. Two crimson\\nglows on the mask glared.\\n        \"Fleric, so......the Arch Bishop is here. Even your powers cannot\\n\\x0c\\nstop me! The 4 moons give me power beyond your comprehension. Taste the\\nfury of fire!\" A gigantic ball of flames rushed towards Fleric. Lifting his\\nmythril shield, the blaze rebounded back at the dark warrior! This was such\\na surprise Garlock never decreased the density of his molecules.\\n        \"Aaaaaarh! You shall pay for this outrage!\" cursed Garlock, who\\nright now was torched.\\n        \"Your the one who is going to visit Apollyn forever!\"\\n        \"I will return...you can count on it. I WILL BE BA-\"\\n        Boris\\'s consciousness flowed back into his brain as his sweaty\\nbiceps glistened in the moonlight.\\n        \"Where\\'s Garlock?\"\\n        \"Cremated\"\\n        \"Really?\"\\n        \"Yes\"\\n        Annisette, goddess and well revered intentionally smashed 2 moons,\\nFlit and Insanity. The vacuum of space muffled all trace of the collision.\\nNow, all scholars and astronomers wondered what fate did the two moons\\nface?\\n        The party marched back to Arno, as the sad ringing and the chiming\\nof the iron bells reverberated in the darkness of the world.\\n\\n\\x1a\\x1a', ':.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:\\n         -----=====Earth\\'s Dreamlands=====-----\\n           (313)558-5024 {14.4} (313)558-5517\\n              A BBS for text file junkies\\n              RPGNet GM File Archive Site\\n.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.\\n\\n                The Five Orange Pips\\n\\n  When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock\\nHolmes cases between the years \\'82 and \\'90, I am faced by so\\nmany which present strange and interesting features that it is no\\neasy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some,\\nhowever, have already gained publicity through the papers, and\\nothers have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which\\nmy friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the\\nobject of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his\\nanalytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without\\nan ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and\\nhave their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and sur-\\nmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remark-\\nable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted\\nto give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points\\nin connection with it which never have been, and probably never\\nwill be, entirely cleared up.\\n  The year \\'87 furnished us with a long series of cases of\\ngreater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my\\nheadings under this one twelve months I find an account of the\\nadventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant\\nSociety, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a\\nfurniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the\\nBritish bark Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the\\nGrice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell\\npoisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock\\nHolmes was able, by winding up the dead man\\'s watch, to prove\\nthat it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore\\nthe deceased had gone to bed within that time -- a deduction\\nwhich was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All\\nthese I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them\\npresent such singular features as the strange train of circum-\\nstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\\n  It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial\\ngales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had\\nscreamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that\\neven here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were\\nforced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life\\nand to recognize the presence of those great elemental forces\\nwhich shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilization, like\\nuntamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew\\nhigher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in\\nthe chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other\\nwas deep in one of Clark Russell\\'s fine sea-stories until the howl\\nof the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the\\nsplash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea\\nwaves. My wife was on a visit to her mother\\'s, and for a few\\ndays I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker\\nStreet.\\n  \"Why,\" said I, glancing up at my companion, \"that was\\nsurely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours,\\nperhaps?\"\\n  \"Except yourself I have none,\" he answered. \"I do not\\nencourage visitors.\"\\n  \"A client, then?\"\\n  \"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man\\nout on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is\\nmore likely to be some crony of the landlady\\'s.\"\\n  Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for\\nthere came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He\\nstretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself\\nand towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\\n  \"Come in!\" said he.\\n  The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the\\noutside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refine-\\nment and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which\\nhe held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the\\nfierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him\\nanxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face\\nwas pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed\\ndown with some great anxiety.\\n  \"l owe you an apology,\" he said, raising his golden pince-nez\\nto his eyes. \"I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have\\nbrought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\"\\n  \"Give me your coat and umbrella,\" said Holmes. \"They may\\nrest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come\\nup from the south-west, I see.\"\\n  \"Yes, from Horsham.\"\\n  \"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps\\nis quite distinctive.\"\\n  \"I have come for advice.\"\\n  \"That is easily got.\"\\n  \"And help.\"\\n  \"That is not always so easy.\"\\n  \"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major\\nPrendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\"\\n  \"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at\\ncards.\"\\n  \"He said that you could solve anything.\"\\n  \"He said too much.\"\\n  \"That you are never beaten.\"\\n  \"I have been beaten four times  -  three times by men, and\\nonce by a woman.\"\\n  \"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\"\\n  \"It is true that I have been generally successful.\"\\n  \"Then you may be so with me.\"\\n  \"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour\\nme with some details as to your case.\"\\n  \"It is no ordinary one.\"\\n  \"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of\\nappeal.\"\\n  \"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you\\nhave ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of\\nevents than those which have happened in my own family.\"\\n  \"You fill me with interest,\" said Holmes. \"Pray give us the\\nessential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards\\nquestion you as to those details which seem to me to be most\\nimportant.\"\\n  The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out\\ntowards the blaze.\\n  \"My name,\" said he, \"is John Openshaw, but my own affairs\\nhave, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful\\nbusiness. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea\\nof the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\\n  \"You must know that my grandfather had two sons -- my\\nuncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory\\nat Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of\\nbicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire,\\nand his business met with such success that he was able to sell it\\nand to retire upon a handsome competence.\\n  \"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young\\nman and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to\\nhave done very well. At the time of the war he fought in\\nJackson\\'s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be\\na colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his\\nplantation, where he remained for three or four years. About\\n1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in\\nSussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune\\nin the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to\\nthe negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extend-\\ning the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and\\nquick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a\\nmost retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at\\nHorsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a\\ngarden and two or three fields round his house, and there he\\nwould take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he\\nwould never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and\\nsmoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not\\nwant any friends, not even his own brother.\\n  \"He didn\\'t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the\\ntime when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so.\\nThis would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine\\nyears in England. He begged my father to let me live with him\\nand he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he\\nused to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me,\\nand he would make me his representative both with the servants\\nand with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I\\nwas quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go\\nwhere I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb\\nhim in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however,\\nfor he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics,\\nwhich was invariably locked, and which he would never permit\\neither me or anyone else to enter. With a boy\\'s curiosity I have\\npeeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more\\nthan such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be\\nexpected in such a room.\\n  \"One day -- it was in March, 1883 -- a letter with a foreign\\nstamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel\\'s plate. It was\\nnot a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were\\nall paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \\'From\\nIndia!\\' said he as he took it up, \\'Pondicherry postmark! What\\ncan this be?\\' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little\\ndried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began\\nto laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the\\nsight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\\nskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he\\nstill held in his trembling hand, \\'K. K. K.!\\' he shrieked, and\\nthen, \\'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\\'\\n  \" \\'What is it, uncle?\\' I cried.\\n  \" \\'Death,\\' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his\\nroom, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope\\nand saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the\\ngum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else\\nsave the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his over-\\npowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the\\nstair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must\\nhave belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box,\\nlike a cashbox, in the other.\\n  \" \\'They may do what they like, but I\\'ll checkmate them still,\\'\\nsaid he with an oath. \\'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my\\nroom to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\\'\\n  \"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked\\nto step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the\\ngrate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper,\\nwhile the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced\\nat the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed\\nthe treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\\n  \" \\'I wish you, John,\\' said my uncle, \\'to witness my will. I\\nleave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages,\\nto my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to\\nyou. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you\\ncannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest\\nenemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I\\ncan\\'t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the\\npaper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\\'\\n  \"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away\\nwith him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the\\ndeepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it\\nevery way in my mind without being able to make anything of it.\\nYet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left\\nbehind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed\\nand nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I\\ncould see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than\\never, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his\\ntime he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the\\ninside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken\\nfrenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the\\ngarden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was\\nafraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a\\nsheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over\\nhowever, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and\\nbar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer\\nagainst the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such\\ntimes I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with\\nmoisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\\n  \"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not\\nto abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of\\nthose drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found\\nhim, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little\\ngreen-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There\\nwas no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet\\ndeep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,\\nbrought in a verdict of \\'suicide.\\' But I, who knew how he\\nwinced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\\nmyself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter\\npassed, however, and my father entered into possession of the\\nestate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the\\nbank.\"\\n  \"One moment,\" Holmes interposed, \"your statement is, I\\nforesee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever lis-\\ntened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the\\nletter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\"\\n  \"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven\\nweeks later, upon the night of May 2d.\"\\n  \"Thank you. Pray proceed.\"\\n  \"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my\\nrequest, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been\\nalways locked up. We found the brass box there, although its\\ncontents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a\\npaper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and\\n\\'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\\' written beneath.\\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had\\nbeen destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\\nnothing of much importance in the attic save a great many\\nscattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\\'s life in\\nAmerica. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he\\nhad done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave\\nsoldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the\\nSouthern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he\\nhad evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag\\npoliticians who had been sent down from the North.\\n  \"Well, it was the beginning of \\'84 when my father came to\\nlive at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until\\nthe January of \\'85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard\\nmy father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the\\nbreakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened enve-\\nlope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched\\npalm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called\\nmy cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very\\nscared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon\\nhimself.\\n  \" \\'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\\' he stammered.\\n  \"My heart had turned to lead. \\'It is K. K. K.,\\' said I.\\n  \"He looked inside the envelope. \\'So it is,\\' he cried. \\'Here are\\nthe very letters. But what is this written above them?\\'\\n  \" \\'Put the papers on the sundial,\\' I read, peeping over his\\nshoulder.\\n  \" \\'What papers? What sundial?\\' he asked.\\n  \" \\'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\\' said I; \\'but\\nthe papers must be those that are destroyed.\\'\\n  \" \\'Pooh!\\' said he, gripping hard at his courage. \\'We are in a\\ncivilized land here, and we can\\'t have tomfoolery of this kind.\\nWhere does the thing come from?\\'\\n  \" \\'From Dundee,\\' I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\n  \" \\'Some preposterous practical joke,\\' said he. \\'What have I to\\ndo with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such\\nnonsense.\\'\\n  \" \\'I should certainly speak to the police,\\' I said.\\n  \" \\'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\\'\\n  \" \\'Then let me do so?\\'\\n  \" \\'No, I forbid you. I won\\'t have a fuss made about such\\nnonsense.\\'\\n  \"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate\\nman. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of\\nforebodings.\\n  \"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went\\nfrom home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is\\nin command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad\\nthat he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from\\ndanger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in\\nerror. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram\\nfrom the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had\\nfallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the\\nneighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I\\nhurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recov-\\nered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning\\nfrom Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown\\nto him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in\\nbringing in a verdict of \\'death from accidental causes.\\' Carefully\\nas I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable\\nto find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There\\nwere no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record\\nof strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not\\ntell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was\\nwell-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\n  \"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask\\nme why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well\\nconvinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an\\nincident in my uncle\\'s life, and that the danger would be as\\npressing in one house as in another.\\n  \"It was in January, \\'85, that my poor father met his end, and\\ntwo years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that\\ntime I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope\\nthat this curse had passed way from the family, and that it had\\nended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too\\nsoon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very\\nshape in which it had come upon my father.\"\\n  The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope,\\nand turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried\\norange pips.\\n  \"This is the envelope,\" he continued. \"The postmark is\\nLondon -- eastern division. Within are the very words which\\nwere upon my father\\'s last message: \\'K. K. K.\\'; and then \\'Put\\nthe papers on the sundial.\\' \"\\n  \"What have you done?\\'\\' asked Holmes.\\n  \"Nothing.\"\\n  \"Nothing?\"\\n  \"To tell the truth\" -- he sank his face into his thin, white\\nhands -- \"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor\\nrabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the\\ngrasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and\\nno precautions can guard against.\"\\n  \"Tut! tut!\" cried Sherlock Holmes. \"You must act, man, or\\nyou are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time\\nfor despair.\"\\n  \"I have seen the police.\"\\n  \"Ah!\"\\n  \"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced\\nthat the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all\\npractical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really\\naccidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with\\nthe warnings.\"\\n  Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \"Incredible\\nimbecility!\" he cried.\\n  \"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may re-\\nmain in the house with me.\"\\n  \"Has he come with you to-night?\"\\n  \"No. His orders were to stay in the house.\"\\n  Again Holmes raved in the air.\\n  \"Why did you come to me,\" he cried, \"and, above all, why\\ndid you not come at once?\"\\n  \"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major\\nPrendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come\\nto you.\"\\n  \"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have\\nacted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than\\nthat which you have placed before us -- no suggestive detail\\nwhich might help us?\"\\n  \"There is one thing,\" said John Openshaw. He rummaged in\\nhis coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-\\ntinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. \"I have some remem-\\nbrance,\" said he, \"that on the day when my uncle burned the\\npapers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay\\namid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single\\nsheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that\\nit may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out\\nfrom among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction.\\nBeyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I\\nthink myself that it is a page from some private diary. The\\nwriting is undoubtedly my uncle\\'s.\"\\n  Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of\\npaper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been\\ntorn from a book. It was headed, \"March, 1869,\" and beneath\\nwere the following enigmatical notices:\\n\\n     4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\n\\n     7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain,\\n          of St. Augustine.\\n     9th. McCauley cleared.\\n     1Oth. John Swain cleared.\\n     12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\\n\\n  \"Thank you!\" said Holmes, folding up the paper and return-\\ning it to our visitor. \"And now you must on no account lose\\nanother instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you\\nhave told me. You must get home instantly and act.\"\\n  \"What shall I do?\"\\n  \"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You\\nmust put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the\\nbrass box which you have described. You must also put in a note\\nto say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and\\nthat this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in\\nsuch words as will carry conviction with them. Having done\\nthis, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as\\ndirected. Do you understand?\"\\n  \"Entirely.\"\\n  \"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I\\nthink that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have\\nour web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first\\nconsideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens\\nyou. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the\\nguilty parties.\"\\n  \"I thank you,\" said the young man, rising and pulling on his\\novercoat. \"You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall\\ncertainly do as you advise.\"\\n  \"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself\\nin the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that\\nyou are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do\\nyou go back?\\n  \"By train from Waterloo.\"\\n  \"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so l trust that\\nyou may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too\\nclosely.\"\\n  \"I am armed.\"\\n  \"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\"\\n  \"I shall see you at Horsham, then?\"\\n  \"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek\\nit.\"\\n  \"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with\\nnews as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in\\nevery particular.\" He shook hands with us and took his leave.\\nOutside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pat-\\ntered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to\\nhave come to us from amid the mad elements -- blown in upon us\\nlike a sheet of sea-weed in a gale -- and now to have been\\nreabsorbed by them once more.\\n  Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head\\nsunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire.\\nThen he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the\\nblue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\\n  \"I think, Watson,\" he remarked at last, \"that of all our cases\\nwe have had none more fantastic than this.\"\\n  \"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\"\\n  \"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw\\nseems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the\\nSholtos.\"\\n  \"But have you,\" I asked, \"formed any definite conception as\\nto what these perils are?\"\\n  \"There can be no question as to their nature,\" he answered.\\n  \"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he\\npursue this unhappy family?\"\\n  Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon\\nthe arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \"The ideal\\nreasoner,\" he remarked, \"would, when he had once been shown\\na single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the\\nchain of events which led up to it but also all the results which\\nwould follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a\\nwhole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the\\nobserver who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of\\nincidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones,\\nboth before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which\\nthe reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the\\nstudy which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by\\nthe aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest\\npitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all\\nthe facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself\\nimplies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge,\\nwhich, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias,\\nis a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible,\\nhowever, that a man should possess all knowledge which is\\nlikely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeav-\\noured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one\\noccasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits\\nin a very precise fashion.\"\\n  \"Yes,\" I answered, laughing. \"It was a singular document.\\nPhilosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I\\nremember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the\\nmud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry\\neccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime\\nrecords unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and\\nself-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the\\nmain points of my analysis.\"\\n  Holmes grinned at the last item. \"Well,\" he said, \"I say\\nnow, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic\\nstocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest\\nhe can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can\\nget it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has\\nbeen submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our\\nresources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American\\nEncyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank\\nyou. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be\\ndeduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong\\npresumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong rea-\\nson for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change\\nall their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of\\nFlorida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His\\nextreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was\\nin fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a\\nworking hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something\\nwhich drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we\\ncan only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which\\nwere received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the\\npostmarks of those letters?\"\\n  \"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee,\\nand the third from London.\"\\n  \"From East London. What do you deduce from that?\"\\n  \"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a\\nship.\"\\n  \"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt\\nthat the probability -- the strong probability -- is that the writer\\nwas on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point.\\nIn the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the\\nthreat and its fulfillment, in Dundee it was only some three or\\nfour days. Does that suggest anything?\"\\n  \"A greater distance to travel.\"\\n  \"But the letter had also a greater distance to come.\"\\n  \"Then I do not see the point.\"\\n  \"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the\\nman or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always seni\\ntheir singular warning or token before them when starting upon\\ntheir mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign\\nwhen it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry\\nin a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their\\nletter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that\\nthose seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-\\nboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought\\nthe writer.\"\\n  \"It is possible.\"\\n  \"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly\\nurgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to\\ncaution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which\\nit would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one\\ncomes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\"\\n  \"Good God!\" I cried. \"What can it mean, this relentless\\npersecution?\"\\n  \"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital\\nimportance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think\\nthat it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A\\nsingle man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way\\nas to deceive a coroner\\'s jury. There must have been several in\\nit, and they must have been men of resource and determination.\\nTheir papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it\\nmay. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an\\nindividual and becomes the badge of a society.\"\\n  \"But of what society?\"\\n  \"Have you never --\" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward\\nand sinking his voice --\"have you never heard of the Ku Klux\\nKlan?\"\\n  \"I never have.\"\\n  Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee.\\n\"Here it is,\" said he presently:\\n\\n      \"Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resem-\\n    blance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This\\n    terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate\\n    soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it\\n    rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the\\n    country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas,\\n    Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political\\n    purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro vot-\\n    ers and the murdering and driving from the country of\\n    those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were\\n    usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in\\n    some fantastic but generally recognized shape -- a sprig of\\n    oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in\\n    others. On receiving this the victim might either openly\\n    abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If\\n    he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come\\n    upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen\\n    manner. So perfect was the organization of the society,\\n    and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case\\n    upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with\\n    impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced\\n    home to the perpetrators. For some years the organization\\n    flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States\\n    government and of the better classes of the community in\\n    the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement\\n    rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been spo-\\n    radic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\\n\\n  \"You will observe,\" said Holmes, laying down the volume,\\n\"that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with\\nthe disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers.\\nIt may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he\\nand his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon\\ntheir track. You can understand that this register and diary may\\nimplicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may\\nbe many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\"\\n  \"Then the page we have seen --\"\\n  \"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \\'sent\\nthe pips to A, B, and C\\' -- that is, sent the society\\'s warning to\\nthem. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or\\nleft the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a\\nsinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some\\nlight into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance\\nyoung Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told\\nhim. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so\\nhand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour\\nthe miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our\\nfellowmen.\"\\n\\n  It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a\\nsubdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the\\ngreat city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I\\ncame down.\\n  \"You will excuse me for not waiting for you,\" said he; \"I\\nhave, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this\\ncase of young Openshaw\\'s.\"\\n  \"What steps will you take?\" I asked.\\n  \"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquir-\\nies. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\"\\n  \"You will not go there first?\"\\n  \"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and\\nthe maid will bring up your coffee.\"\\n  As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table\\nand glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent\\na chill to my heart.\\n  \"Holmes,\" I cried, \"you are too late.\"\\n  \"Ah!\" said he, laying down his cup, \"I feared as much. How\\nwas it done?\" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was\\ndeeply moved.\\n  \"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading\\n\\'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.\\' Here is the account:\\n\\n      \"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook,\\n    of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a\\n    cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however,\\n    was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help\\n    of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a\\n    rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of\\n    the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It\\n    proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it\\n    appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket,\\n    was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.\\n    It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to\\n    catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his\\n    haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and\\n    walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for\\n    river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence,\\n    and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the\\n    victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the\\n    effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condi-\\n    tion of the riverside landing-stages.\"\\n\\n  We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed\\nand shaken than I had ever seen him.\\n  \"That hurts my pride, Watson,\" he said at last. \"It is a petty\\nfeeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal\\nmatter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my\\nhand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and\\nthat I should send him away to his death --!\" He sprang from his\\nchair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with\\na flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and\\nunclasping of his long thin hands.\\n  \"They must be cunning devils,\" he exclaimed at last. \"How\\ncould they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is\\nnot on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was\\ntoo crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well,\\nWatson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going\\nout now!\"\\n  \"To the police?\"\\n  \"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web\\nthey may take the flies, but not before.\"\\n  All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was\\nlate in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock\\nHolmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o\\'clock before\\nhe entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the side-\\nboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it vora-\\nciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\\n  \"You are hungry,\" I remarked.\\n  \"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing\\nsince breakfast.\"\\n  \"Nothing?\"\\n  \"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.\"\\n  \"And how have you succeeded?\"\\n  \"Well.\"\\n  \"You have a clue?\"\\n  \"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw\\nshall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their\\nown devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\"\\n  \"What do you mean?\"\\n  He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces\\nhe squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five\\nand thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he\\nwrote \"S. H. for J. 0.\" Then he sealed it and addressed it to\\n\"Captain James Calhoun, Bark Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia.\"\\n  \"That will await him when he enters port,\" said he, chuck-\\nling. \"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a\\nprecursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\"\\n  \"And who is this Captain Calhoun?\"\\n  \"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\"\\n  \"How did you trace it, then?\"\\n  He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered\\nwith dates and names.\\n  \"I have spent the whole day,\" said he, \"over Lloyd\\'s regis-\\nters and files of the old papers, following the future career of\\nevery vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and Febru-\\nary in \\'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which\\nwere reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone\\nStar, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was\\nreported as having cleared from London, the name is that which\\nis given to one of the states of the Union.\"\\n  \"Texas, I think.\"\\n  \"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship\\nmust have an American origin.\"\\n  \"What then?\"\\n  \"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the\\nbark Lone Star was there in January, \\'85, my suspicion became a\\ncertainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in\\nthe port of London.\"\\n  \"Yes?\"\\n  \"The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to\\nthe Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the\\nriver by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savan-\\nnah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some\\ntime ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is\\nnow past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\"\\n  \"What will you do, then?\"\\n  \"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are\\nas I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others\\nare Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three\\naway from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who\\nhas been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship\\nreaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and\\nthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these\\nthree gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\"\\n  There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,\\nand the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the\\norange pips which would show them that another, as cunning\\nand as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long\\nand very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited\\nlong for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever\\nreached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the\\nAtlantic a shattered stern-post of the boat was seen swinging in\\nthe trough of a wave, with the letters \"L. S.\" carved upon it,\\nand that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone\\nStar.\\n\\x1a', '                               SIX ABLE MEN  \\n\\n   Once upon a time there lived a young soldier named Martin who had enlisted \\nin the royal army to flght a war. The war was long but victorious and when the\\nKing abandoned the enemy\\'s territory and returned with his troops to the \\nhomeland, he left Martin to guard the only bridge on the river that separated \\nthe two nations.\\n   \"Stay on watch on the bridge,\" the King ordered. \"Don\\'t let any enemy \\nsoldier go by.\" Days and then months passed, and the soldier kept his watch on\\nthe bridge. He survived by asking the passers-by for food and, after two \\nyears, thought that the authorities had probably forgotten him. He then headed\\ntowards the capital, where he would ask the King for all his back pay. His \\npockets were empty and his only possessions were a pipe, a bit of tobacco and \\nhis sword.\\n   A couple of days later he arrived in a valley where a stream crossed his \\npath. A big man with hands as big as hams, large shoulders and a bull\\'s neck \\nwas sitting by the stream. The man, who had a strangely soft and kind voice, \\nasked him:\\n   \"Would you like to cross the stream?\" The soldier couldn\\'t ask for more. \\nThe man effortlessly uprooted a huge tree and laid it across the stream. \\nMartin offered the man some of his tobacco in return and when he found out \\nthat the man had nothing to do, Martin asked him to come along.\\n   \"You\\'ll see all the things we can do together!\"\\n   They had just begun walking away when they met a hunter who was aiming his \\nrifle at a faraway hill.\\n   \"What are you aiming at?\"\\n   \"Do you see that cobweb on that tree on top of the hill?\" the hunter asked.\\n\"I want to get the spider!\" The hunter shot and when the three men got to the \\ntop of the hill they found a big hole in the middle of the cobweb and no more \\nspider. Martin had never seen anyone shoot that well and he asked the hunter \\nto join them. \\n   \"Come with us and you\\'ll be in luck!\" The three men walked and walked until\\nthey arrived at a windmill. The wheel of the mill was turning even though \\nthere was no wind. The men were puzzled but further up the road they found a \\nfat man sitting on a tree stump. The man was blowing through one of his \\nnostrils in the mill\\'s direction. The fat man explained to the three amazed \\nfellow travellers that his strength was such that he could sneeze up a \\nhurricane. The soldier convinced him to follow them. As they approached the \\ncity, they were approached by a man who hopped about with his legs tied \\ntogether.\\n   \"Who tied you up?\" they asked in unison.\\n   \"I did it myself,\" the man, who was very young and very thin, answered. \"If\\nI untied myself I would run as fast as the wind and would not enjoy the \\nsights.\" And so it was that even this character, nicknamed Fastfoot by the \\nothers, joined the group. \\n   But the surprises of that extraordinary day were far from over. A little \\nman with a round face sat under a tree. He held his hat over his left ear. \"If\\nI straighten my hat,\" he explained, \"I will freeze everything around me.\" \\nNaturally, everybody took his word for it and the stranger was asked to join \\nthe group. The bizarre company finally arrived at the city. A public notice \\nwas hung outside the city walls. The princess announced that whoever would \\nbeat her in a race could marry her. \\n   The soldier dusted his uniform, cleaned himself up after the long trip and \\nran to the palace. He wanted to challenge the princess but said that one of \\nhis servants would run in his place. The princess accepted his challenge. The \\nmorning after, at the starting line, Fastfoot untied his legs and took off \\nlike a rocket. Each one of the contestants had a jug that had to be filled at \\na nearby stream and brought back full to the finish line. On his way back, \\nFastfoot stopped to pick a flower and after carefully setting the jug on the \\nground and realizing that the princess was still far away, he decided to lie \\ndown and rest for a while. Unfortunately, he fell asleep.\\n   Later on, when the princess caught up with him and saw that he had fallen \\nasleep, she kicked down his jug and ran away. She was sure of her victory. \\nFrom far away the sharp sighted hunter shot and hit a spot near Fastfoot\\'s \\near. Fastfoot woke up all of a sudden and saw the princess approaching the \\nfinish line. He quickly ran back to the stream, filled the jug and reached the\\nfinish line as fast as lightning. The King was furious. He would never let his\\ndaughter marry a miserable soldier.\\n   He invited the unsuspecting Martin to the palace. Martin told him about his\\ntwo years watching over the river, which made the King ever angrier. The King,\\nhowever, pretended to feel guilty and invited the soldier and his friends to a\\nbanquet in a strange dining room. In fact the dining room was lined with iron \\nwalls and was built over a huge furnace. The King ordered his men to seal the \\ndining room\\'s door and to light the furnace. Then he proceeded to watch the \\nslow death of the group through an unbreakable glass. The six men began eating\\nbut suddenly felt the floor grow very hot, while the room\\'s temperature \\nrapidly increased.\\n   But Martin did not lose his head. He straightened the hat of the round \\nfaced little man and pretty soon they were all shivering from the cold. The \\nKing uselessly urged his men to throw more and more wood in the furnace, but \\nthe soldier and his fnends had found a remedy to the King\\'s wickedness. No one\\nhad ever come out of this torture chamber alive, but this time the King had to\\naccept defeat, even though he was still determined not to let his daughter go.\\nHe offered the soldier a large sum of money as long as he gave up the wedding.\\n   \"I will fill you a bag of gold and other riches if you forget the wedding.\"\\n   \"That\\'s fine with me,\" Martin said, \"and I accept your offer but as long as\\nI pick the bag and the man who will carry it away.\" The poor King was unaware \\nof the strength of one of the six friends. When he began filling the sack, all\\nof his gold was not enough to fill it. Martin and his friends were rich. When \\nthey left court, the King had become very poor.\\n   The monarch lost his temper and realized the soldier had fooled him. He \\ncalled the army commander and ordered two battalions to chase Martin. \"Bring \\nthem back dead or alive and at all costs!\" Later on, the soldiers caught up \\nwith the six young men and surrounded them.\\n   \"Give us back the gold and surrender,\" they demanded. But the fattest of the\\nmen began blowing so hard that horses and soldiers were carried away. In just a\\nfew minutes the wounded soldiers were scattered all over the plain and the\\nbattalions were no longer a threat to the six extraordinary friends who \\ncontinued their journey. \\n   Then they divided the gold and jewels in equal parts and each one of them \\nwent his own separate way.

In return\\nfor the news which Lestrde would bring, Holmes was always\\nready to listen with attention to the details of any case upon\\nwhich the detective was engaged, and was able occasionally\\nwithout any active interference, to give some hint or suggestion\\ndrawn from his own vast knowledge and experience.\\n  On this particular evening, Lestrade had spoken of the weather\\nand the newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully\\nat his cigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.\\n  \"Anything remarkable on hand?\" he asked.\\n  \"Oh, no, Mr. Holmes -- nothing very particular.\"\\n  \"Then tell me about it.\"\\n  Lestrade laughed.\\n  \"Well, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there is\\nsomething on my mind. And yet it is such an absurd business,\\nthat I hesitated to bother you about it. On the other hand,\\nalthough it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that\\nyou have a taste for all that is out of the common. But, in my\\nopinion, it comes more in Dr. Watson\\'s line than ours.\"\\n  \"Disease?\" said I.\\n  \"Madness, anyhow. And a queer madness, too. You wouldn\\'t\\nthink there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a\\nhatred of Napoleon the First that he would break any image of\\nhim that he could see.\"\\n  Holmes sank back in his chair.\\n  \"That\\'s no business of mine,\" said he.\\n  \"Exactly. That\\'s what I said. But then, when the man com-\\nmits burglary in order to break images which are not his own,\\nthat brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman.\"\\n  Holmes sat up again.\\n  \"Burglary! This is more interesting. Let me hear the details.\"\\n  Lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his mem-\\nory from its pages.\\n  \"The first case reported was four days ago,\" said he. \"It was\\nat the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of\\npictures and statues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had\\nleft the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and\\nhurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood\\nwith several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered\\ninto fragments. He rushed out into the road, but, although sev-\\neral passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of\\nthe shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any\\nmeans of identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those\\nsenseless acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to time,\\nand it was reported to the constable on the beat as such. The\\nplaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings, and the\\nwhole affair appeared to be too childish for any particular\\ninvestigation.\\n  \"The second case, however, was more serious, and also more\\nsingular. It occurred only last night.\\n  \"In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of\\nMorse Hudson\\'s shop, there lives a well-known medical practi-\\ntioner, named Dr. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices\\nupon the south side of the Thames. His residence and principal\\nconsulting-room is at Kennington Road, but he has a branch\\nsurgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles away.\\nThis Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his\\nhouse is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French Em-\\nperor. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson\\ntwo duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by\\nthe French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in his hall in\\nthe house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece\\nof the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr. Barnicot came\\ndown this morning he was astonished to find that his house had\\nbeen burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken\\nsave the plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and\\nhad been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which\\nits splintered fragments were discovered.\"\\n  Holmes rubbed his hands.\\n  \"This is certainly very novel,\" said he.\\n  \"I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end\\nyet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o\\'clock, and\\nyou can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he\\nfound that the window had been opened in the night, and that the\\nbroken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room.\\nIt had been smashed to atoms where it stood. In neither case\\nwere there any signs which could give us a clue as to the\\ncriminal or lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes,\\nyou have got the facts.\"\\n  \"They are singular, not to say grotesque,\" said Holmes.\\n\"May I ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot\\'s\\nrooms were the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed\\nin Morse Hudson\\'s shop?\"\\n  \"They were taken from the same mould.\"\\n  \"Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who\\nbreaks them is influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon.\\nConsidering how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor\\nmust exist in London, it is too much to suppose such a coinci-\\ndence as that a promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin\\nupon three specimens of the same bust.\"\\n  \"Well, I thought as you do,\" said Lestrade. \"On the other\\nhand, this Morse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of\\nLondon, and these three were the only ones which had been in\\nhis shop for years. So, although, as you say, there are many\\nhundreds of statues in London, it is very probable that these\\nthree were the only ones in that district. Therefore, a local\\nfanatic would begin with them. What do you think, Dr. Watson?\"\\n  \"There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,\" I\\nanswered. \"There is the condition which the modern French\\npsychologists have called the \\'idee fixe,\\' which may be trifling in\\ncharacter, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other\\nway. A man who had read deeply about Napoleon, or who had\\npossibly received some hereditary family injury through the great\\nwar, might conceivably form such an idee fixe and under its\\ninfluence be capable of any fantastic outrage.\"\\n  \"That won\\'t do, my dear Watson,\" said Holmes, shaking his\\nhead, \"for no amount of idee fixe would enable your interesting\\nmonomaniac to find out where these busts were situated.\"\\n  \"Well, how do you explain it?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a\\ncertain method in the gentleman\\'s eccentric proceedings. For\\nexample, in Dr. Barnicot\\'s hall, where a sound might arouse the\\nfamily, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas\\nin the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was\\nsmashed where it stood. The affair seems absurdly trifling, and\\nyet I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some of my most\\nclassic cases have had the least promising commencement. You\\nwill remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of the Abernetty\\nfamily was first brought to my notice by the depth which the\\nparsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I can\\'t afford,\\ntherefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I\\nshall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any\\nfresh development of so singular a chain of events.\"\\n\\n  The development for which my friend had asked came in a\\nquicker and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have\\nimagined. I was still dressing in my bedroom next morning,\\nwhen there was a tap at the door and Holmes entered, a\\ntelegram in his hand. He read it aloud:\\n\\n     \"Come instantly, 131 Pitt Street, Kensington.\\n                                        \"LESTRADE.\\n\\n  \"What is it, then?\" I asked.\\n  \"Don\\'t know -- may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel\\nof the story of the statues. In that case our friend the image-\\nbreaker has begun operations in another quarter of London.\\nThere\\'s coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the\\ndoor.\"\\n  In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little\\nbackwater just beside one of the briskest currents of London life.\\nNo. 131 was one of a row, all flat-chested, respectable, and\\nmost unromantic dwellings. As we drove up, we found the rail-\\nings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd. Holmes\\nwhistled.\\n  \"By George! it\\'s attempted murder at the least. Nothing less\\nwill hold the London message-boy. There\\'s a deed of violence\\nindicated in that fellow\\'s round shoulders and outstretched\\nneck. What\\'s this, Watson? The top steps swilled down and\\nthe other ones dry. Footsteps enough, anyhow! Well, well,\\nthere\\'s Lestrade at the front window, and we shall soon know\\nall about it.\"\\n  The official received us with a very grave face and showed us\\ninto a sitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated el-\\nderly man, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and\\ndown. He was introduced to us as the owner of the house -- Mr.\\nHorace Harker, of the Central Press Syndicate.\\n  \"It\\'s the Napoleon bust business again,\" said Lestrade. \"You\\nseemed interested last night, Mr. Holmes, so I thought perhaps\\nyou would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a\\nvery much graver turn.\"\\n  \"What has it turned to, then?\"\\n  \"To murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen ex-\\nactly what has occurred?\"\\n  The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most mel-\\nancholy face.\\n  \"It\\'s an extraordinary thing,\" said he, \"that all my life I have\\nbeen collecting other people\\'s news, and now that a real piece of\\nnews has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that\\nI can\\'t put two words together. If I had come in here as a\\njournalist, I should have interviewed myself and had two col-\\numns in every evening paper. As it is, I am giving away valu-\\nable copy by telling my story over and over to a string of\\ndifferent people, and I can make no use of it myself. However,\\nI\\'ve heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and if you\\'ll only\\nexplain this queer business, I shall be paid for my trouble in\\ntelling you the story.\"\\n  Holmes sat down and listened.\\n  \"It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I\\nbought for this very room about four months ago. I picked it up\\ncheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street\\nStation. A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night,\\nand I often write until the early morning. So it was to-day. I was\\nsitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the house,\\nabout three o\\'clock, when I was convinced that l heard some\\nsounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated, and I\\nconcluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about\\nfive minutes later, there came a most horrible yell -- the most\\ndreadful sound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my\\nears as long as I live. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or\\ntwo. Then I seized the poker and went downstairs. When I\\nentered this room I found the window wide open, and I at once\\nobserved that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. Why any\\nburglar should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it\\nwas only a plaster cast and of no real value whatever.\\n  \"You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that\\nopen window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long\\nstride. This was clearly what the burglar had done, so I went\\nround and opened the door. Stepping out into the dark, I nearly\\nfell over a dead man, who was lying there. I ran back for a light,\\nand there was the poor fellow, a great gash in his throat and the\\nwhole place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees\\ndrawn up, and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my\\ndreams. I had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I\\nmust have fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the\\npoliceman standing over me in the hall.\"\\n  \"Well, who was the murdered man?\" asked Holmes.\\n  \"There\\'s nothing to show who he was,\" said Lestrade. \"You\\nshall see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of\\nit up to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not\\nmore than thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear\\nto be a labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool\\nof blood beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the\\ndeed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know.\\nThere was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets\\nsave an apple, some string, a shilling map of London, and a\\nphotograph. Here it is.\"\\n  It was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. It\\nrepresented an alert, sharp-featured simian man. with thick eye-\\nbrows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the\\nface, like the muzzle of a baboon.\\n  \"And what became of the bust?\" asked Holmes, after a\\ncareful study of this picture.\\n  \"We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in\\nthe front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It\\nwas broken into fragments. I am going round now to see it. Will\\nyou come?\"\\n  \"Certainly. I must just take one look round.\" He examined\\nthe carpet and the window. \"The fellow had either very long\\nlegs or was a most active man,\" said he. \"With an area beneath,\\nit was no mean feat to reach that window-ledge and open that\\nwindow. Getting back was comparatively simple. Are you com-\\ning with us to see the remains of your bust, Mr. Harker?\"\\n  The disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing-table.\\n  \"I must try and make something of it,\" said he, \"though I\\nhave no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out\\nalready with full details. It\\'s like my luck! You remember when\\nthe stand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in the\\nstand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it, for\\nI was too shaken to write it. And now I\\'ll be too late with a\\nmurder done on my own doorstep.\"\\n  As we left the room, we heard his pen travelling shrilly over\\nthe foolscap.\\n  The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was\\nonly a few hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested\\nupon this presentment of the great emperor, which seemed to\\nraise such frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the\\nunknown. It lay scattered, in splintered shards, upon the grass.\\nHolmes picked up several of them and examined them carefully.\\nI was convinced, from his intent face and his purposeful manner,\\nthat at last he was upon a clue.\\n  \"Well?\" asked Lestrade.\\n  Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\\n  \"We have a long way to go yet,\" said he. \"And yet -- and\\nyet -- well, we have some suggestive facts to act upon. The\\npossession of this trifling bust was worth more, in the eyes of\\nthis strange criminal, than a human life. That is one point. Then\\nthere is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or\\nimmediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole object.\"\\n  \"He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He\\nhardly knew what he was doing.\"\\n  \"Well, that\\'s likely enough. But I wish to call your attention\\nvery particularly to the position of this house, in the garden of\\nwhich the bust was destroyed.\"\\n  Lestrade looked about him.\\n  \"It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be\\ndisturbed in the garden.\"\\n  \"Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street\\nwhich he must have passed before he came to this one. Why did\\nhe not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he\\ncarried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?\"\\n  \"I give it up,\" said Lestrade.\\n  Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.\\n  \"He could see what he was doing here, and he could not\\nthere. That was his reason.\"\\n  \"By Jove! that\\'s true,\" said the detective. \"Now that I come\\nto think of it, Dr. Barnicot\\'s bust was broken not far from his red\\nlamp. Well, Mr. Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?\"\\n  \"To remember it -- to docket it. We may come on something\\nlater which will bear upon it. What steps do you propose to take\\nnow, Lestrade?\"\\n  \"The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to\\nidentify the dead man. There should be no difficulty about that.\\nWhen we have found who he is and who his associates are, we\\nshould have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt\\nStreet last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on\\nthe doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Don\\'t you think so?\"\\n  \"No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should\\napproach the case.\"\\n  \"What would you do then?\"\\n  \"Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. I suggest\\nthat you go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes\\nafterwards, and each will supplement the other.\"\\n  \"Very good,\" said Lestrade.\\n  \"If you are going back to Pitt Street, you might see Mr.\\nHorace Harker. Tell him for me that I have quite made up my\\nmind, and that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic,\\nwith Napoleonic delusions, was in his house last night. It will be\\nuseful for his article.\"\\n  Lestrade stared.\\n  \"You don\\'t seriously believe that?\"\\n  Holmes smiled.\\n  \"Don\\'t I? Well, perhaps I don\\'t. But I am sure that it will\\ninterest Mr. Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central\\nPress Syndicate. Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we\\nhave a long and rather complex day\\'s work before us. I should\\nbe glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at\\nBaker Street at six o\\'clock this evening. Until then I should like\\nto keep this photograph, found in the dead man\\'s pocket. It is\\npossible that I may have to ask your company and assistance\\nupon a small expedition which will have to be undertaken to-\\nnight, if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until\\nthen good-bye and good luck!\"\\n  Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street,\\nwhere we stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the\\nbust had been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr.\\nHarding would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself\\na newcomer, who could give us no information. Holmes\\'s face\\nshowed his disappointment and annoyance.\\n  \"Well, well, we can\\'t expect to have it all our own way,\\nWatson,\" he said, at last. \"We must come back in the after-\\nnoon, if Mr. Harding will not be here until then. I am, as you\\nhave no doubt surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to\\ntheir source, in order to find if there is not something peculiar\\nwhich may account for their remarkable fate. Let us make for\\nMr. Morse Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can\\nthrow any light upon the problem.\"\\n  A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer\\'s establish-\\nment. He was a small, stout man with a red face and a peppery\\nmanner.\\n  \"Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,\" said he. \"What we pay\\nrates and taxes for I don\\'t know, when any ruffian can come in\\nand break one\\'s goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot\\nhis two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot -- that\\'s what I\\nmake it. No one but an anarchist would go about breaking\\nstatues. Red republicans -- that\\'s what I call \\'em. Who did I get\\nthe statues from? I don\\'t see what that has to do with it. Welll, if\\nyou really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in\\nChurch Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the\\ntrade, and have been this twenty years. How many had l?\\nThree -- two and one are three -- two of Dr. Barnicot\\'s, and one\\nsmashed in broad daylight on my own counter. Do I know that\\nphotograph? No, I don\\'t. Yes, I do, though. Why, it\\'s Beppo.\\nHe was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who made himself\\nuseful in the shop. He could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and\\ndo odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and I\\'ve heard\\nnothing of him since. No, I don\\'t know where he came from nor\\nwhere he went to. I had nothing against him while he was here.\\nHe was gone two days before the bust was smashed.\"\\n  \"Well, that\\'s all we could reasonably expect from Morse\\nHudson,\" said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. \"We\\nhave this Beppo as a common factor, both in Kennington and in\\nKensington, so that is worth a ten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let\\nus make for Gelder & Co., of Stepney, the source and origin of\\nthe busts. I shall be surprised if we don\\'t get some help down\\nthere.\"\\n  In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashion-\\nable London, hotel London, theatrical London, literary London,\\ncommercial London, and, finally, maritime London, till we came\\nto a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the\\ntenement houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of Europe.\\nHere, in a broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy City\\nmerchants, we found the sculpture works for which we searched.\\nOutside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry.\\nInside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or\\nmoulding. The manager, a big blond German, received us civilly\\nand gave a clear answer to all Holmes\\'s questions. A reference\\nto his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from\\na marble copy of Devine\\'s head of Napoleon, but that the three\\nwhich had been sent to Morse Hudson a year or so before had\\nbeen half of a batch of six, the other three being sent to Harding\\nBrothers, of Kensington. There was no reason why those six\\nshould be different from any of the other casts. He could suggest\\nno possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them -- in\\nfact, he laughed at the idea. Their wholesale price was six\\nshillings, but the retailer would get twelve or more. The cast\\nwas taken in two moulds from each side of the face, and then\\nthese two profiles of plaster of Paris were joined together to\\nmake the complete bust. The work was usually done by Italians,\\nin the room we were in. When finished, the busts were put on a\\ntable in the passage to dry, and afterwards stored. That was all\\nhe could tell us.\\n  But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect\\nupon the manager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows\\nknotted over his blue Teutonic eyes.\\n  \"Ah, the rascal!\" he cried. \"Yes, indeed, I know him very\\nwell. This has always been a respectable establishment, and the\\nonly time that we have ever had the police in it was over this\\nvery fellow. It was more than a year ago now. He knifed another\\nItalian in the street, and then he came to the works with the\\npolice on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo was his\\nname -- his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engag-\\ning a man with such a face. But he was a good workman -- one\\nof the best.\"\\n  \"What did he get?\"\\n  \"The man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he\\nis out now, but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have\\na cousin of his here, and I daresay he could tell you where he\\nis.\"\\n  \"No, no,\" cried Holmes, \"not a word to the cousin -- not a\\nword, I beg of you. The matter is very important, and the farther\\nI go with it, the more important it seems to grow. When you\\nreferred in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that\\nthe date was June 3rd of last year. Could you give me the date\\nwhen Beppo was arrested?\"\\n  \"I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,\" the manager an-\\nswered. \"Yes,\" he continued, after some turning over of pages,\\n\"he was paid last on May 20th.\"\\n  \"Thank you,\" said Holmes. \"I don\\'t think that I need intrude\\nupon your time and patience any more.\" With a last word of\\ncaution that he should say nothing as to our researches, we\\nturned our faces westward once more.\\n  The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch\\na hasty luncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance\\nannounced \"Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,\" and\\nthe contents of the paper showed that Mr. Horace Harker had got\\nhis account into print after all. Two columns were occupied with\\na highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident.\\nHolmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he\\nate. Once or twice he chuckled.\\n  \"This is all right, Watson,\" said he. \"Listen to this:\\n\\n      \"It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference\\n    of opinion upon this case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the\\n    most experienced members of the official force, and Mr.\\n    Sherlock Holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have\\n    each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of\\n    incidents, which have ended in so tragic a fashion, arise\\n    from lunacy rather than from deliberate crime. No explana-\\n    tion save mental aberration can cover the facts.\\n\\nThe Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution. if you only\\nknow how to use it. And now, if you have quite finished, we\\nwill hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of\\nHarding Brothers has to say on the matter.\"\\n  The founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp\\nlittle person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a\\nready tongue.\\n  \"Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening\\npapers. Mr. Horace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied\\nhim with the bust some months ago. We ordered three busts of\\nthat sort from Gelder & Co., of Stepney. They are all sold now.\\nTo whom? Oh, I daresay by consulting our sales book we could\\nvery easily tell you. Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr.\\nHarker you see, and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum\\nLodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of\\nLower Grove Road, Reading. No, I have never seen this face\\nwhich you show me in the photograph. You would hardly forget\\nit, would you, sir, for I\\'ve seldom seen an uglier. Have we any\\nItalians on the staff? Yes, sir, we have several among our\\nworkpeople and cleaners. I daresay they might get a peep at that\\nsales book if they wanted to. There is no particular reason for\\nkeeping a watch upon that book. Well, well, it\\'s a very strange\\nbusiness, and I hope that you will let me know if anything comes\\nof your inquiries.\"\\n  Holmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding\\'s evi-\\ndence, and I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the\\nturn which affairs were taking. He made no remark, however\\nsave that, unless we hurried, we should be late for our appoint-\\nment with Lestrade. Sure enough, when we reached Baker Street\\nthe detective was already there, and we found him pacing up and\\ndown in a fever of impatience. His look of importance showed\\nthat his day\\'s work had not been in vain.\\n  \"Well?\" he asked. \"What luck, Mr. Holmes?\"\\n  \"We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted\\none,\" my friend explained. \"We have seen both the retailers and\\nalso the wholesale manufacturers. I can trace each of the busts\\nnow from the beginning.\"\\n  \"The busts!\" cried Lestrade. \"Well, well, you have your own\\nmethods, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a\\nword against them, but I think I have done a better day\\'s work\\nthan you. I have identified the dead man.\"\\n  \"You don\\'t say so?\"\\n  \"And found a cause for the crime.\"\\n  \"Splendid!\"\\n  \"We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill\\nand the Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic\\nemblem round his neck. and that, along with his colour, made\\nme think he was from the South. Inspector Hill knew him the\\nmoment he caught sight of him. His name is Pietro Venucci,\\nfrom Naples, and he is one of the greatest cut-throats in Lon-\\ndon. He is connected with the Mafia, which, as you know, is a\\nsecret political society, enforcing its decrees by murder. Now,\\nyou see how the affair begins to clear up. The other fellow is\\nprobably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia. He has\\nbroken the rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his track.\\nProbably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man him-\\nself, so that he may not knife the wrong person. He dogs the\\nfellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and\\nin the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. How is that, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes?\"\\n  Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.\\n  \"Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!\" he cried. \"But I didn\\'t quite\\nfollow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.\"\\n  \"The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head.\\nAfter all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It\\nis the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I\\nam gathering all the threads into my hands.\"\\n  \"And the next stage?\"\\n  \"Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian\\nQuarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest\\nhim on the charge of murder. Will you come with us?\"\\n  \"I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I\\ncan\\'t say for certain, because it all depends -- well, it all depends\\nupon a factor which is completely outside our control. But I have\\ngreat hopes -- in fact, the betting is exactly two to one -- that if\\nyou will come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay\\nhim by the heels.\"\\n  \"In the Italian Quarter?\"\\n  \"No, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to\\nfind him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night,\\nLestrade, I\\'ll promise to go to the Italian Quarter with you\\nto-morrow, and no harm will be done by the delay. And now I\\nthink that a few hours\\' sleep would do us all good, for I do not\\npropose to leave before eleven o\\'clock, and it is unlikely that we\\nshall be back before morning. You\\'ll dine with us, Lestrade, and\\nthen you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In\\nthe meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an\\nexpress messenger, for I have a letter to send and it is imponant\\nthat it should go at once.\"\\n  Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the\\nold daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed.\\nWhen at last he descended, it was with triumph in his eyes, but\\nhe said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches.\\nFor my own part, I had followed step by step the methods by\\nwhich he had traced the various windings of this complex case,\\nand, though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would\\nreach, I understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque\\ncriminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one\\nof which, I remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object\\nof our journey was to catch him in the very act, and I could not\\nbut admire the cunning with which my friend had inserted a\\nwrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow the idea\\nthat he could continue his scheme with impunity. I was not\\nsurprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver\\nwith me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop,\\nwhich was his favourite weapon.\\n  A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove\\nto a spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the\\ncabman was directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a\\nsecluded road fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its\\nown grounds. In the light of a street lamp we read \"Laburnum\\nVilla\" upon the gate-post of one of them. The occupants had\\nevidently retired to rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over\\nthe hall door, which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden\\npath. The wooden fence which separated the grounds from the\\nroad threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it\\nwas that we crouched.\\n  \"I fear that you\\'ll have a long wait,\" Holmes whispered.\\n\"We may thank our stars that it is not raining. I don\\'t think we\\ncan even venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it\\'s a two\\nto one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.\"\\n  It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as\\nHolmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and\\nsingular fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us\\nof his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark\\nfigure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path.\\nWe saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and\\ndisappear against the black shadow of the house. There was a\\nlong pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very\\ngentle creaking sound came to our ears. The window was being\\nopened. The noise ceased, and again there was a long silence.\\nThe fellow was making his way into the house. We saw the\\nsudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. What he sought\\nwas evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through\\nanother blind. and then through another.\\n  \"Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he\\nclimbs out.\" Lestrade whispered.\\n  But before we could move. the man had emerged again. As he\\ncame out into the glimmering patch of light, we saw that he\\ncarrled something white under his arm. He looked stealthily all\\nround him. The silence of the deserted street reassured him.\\nTurning his back upon us he laid down his burden, and the next\\ninstant there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter\\nand rattle. The man was so intent upon what he was doing that\\nhe never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. With\\nthe bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later\\nLestrade and I had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had\\nbeen fastened. As we turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow\\nface, with writhing, furious features. glaring up at us, and I\\nknew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had\\nsecured.\\n  But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his\\nattention. Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most\\ncarefully examining that which the man had brought from the\\nhouse. It was a bust of Napoleon. Iike the one which we had\\nseen that morning, and it had been broken into similar frag-\\nments. Carefully Holmes held each separate shard to the light,\\nbut in no way did it differ from any other shattered piece of\\nplaster. He had just completed his examination when the hall\\nlights flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the house, a\\njovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented himseli.\\n  \"Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?\" said Holmes.     \\n  \"Yes, sir and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had\\nthe note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did\\nexactly what you told me. We locked every door on the inside\\nand awaited developments. Well, I\\'m very glad to see that you\\nhave got the rascal. I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and\\nhave some refreshment.\"\\n  However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe\\nquarters, so within a few minutes our cab had bcen summoned\\nand we were all tour upon our way to London. Not a word\\nwould our captive say. but he glared at us from thc shadow of\\nhis matted hair. and once. when my hand seemed within his\\nreach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. We stayed long\\nenough at the police-station to learn that a search of his clothing\\nrevealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife, the\\nhandle of which bore copious traces of recent blood.\\n  \"That\\'s all right,\" said Lestrade, as we parted. \"Hill knows\\nall these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You\\'ll find that\\nmy theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I\\'m sure I am\\nexceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike\\nway in which you laid hands upon him. I don\\'t quite understand\\nit all yet.\"\\n  \"I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,\" said\\nHolmes. \"Besides, there are one or two details which are not\\nfinished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth\\nworking out to the very end. If you will come round once more\\nto my rooms at six o\\'clock to-morrow, I think I shall be able to\\nshow you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning\\nof this business, which presents some features which make it\\nabsolutely original in the history of crime. If ever I permit you to\\nchronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee that\\nyou will enliven your pages by an account of the singular\\nadventure of the Napoleonic busts.\"\\n  When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with\\nmuch information concerning our prisoner. His name, it ap-\\npeared, was Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-\\nknown ne\\'er-do-well among the Italian colony. He had once\\nbeen a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living, but he\\nhad taken to evil courses and had twice already been in jail --\\nonce for a petty theft, and once, as we had already heard, for\\nstabbing a fellow-countryman. He could talk English perfectly\\nwell. His reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown,\\nand he refused to answer any questions upon the subject, but the\\npolice had discovered that these same busts might very well have\\nbeen made by his own hands, since he was engaged in this class\\nof work at the establishment of Gelder & Co. To all this infor-\\nmation, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with\\npolite attention, but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see\\nthat his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of\\nmingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he\\nwas wont to assume. At last he started in his chair, and his eyes\\nbrightened. There had been a ring at the bell. A minute later we\\nheard steps upon the stairs, and an elderly red-faced man with\\ngrizzled side-whiskers was ushered in. In his right hand he\\ncarried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon the\\ntable.\\n  \"Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\"\\n  My friend bowed and smiled. \"Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I\\nsuppose?\" said he.\\n  \"Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains\\nwere awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my\\npossession.\"\\n  \"Exactly.\"\\n  \"I have your letter here. You said, \\'I desire to possess a copy\\nof Devine\\'s Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds\\nfor the one which is in your possession.\\' Is that right?\"\\n  \"Certainly.\"\\n  \"I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not\\nimagine how you knew that I owned such a thing.\"\\n  \"Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation\\nis very simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they\\nhad sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.\"\\n  \"Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?\"\\n  \"No, he did not.\"\\n  \"Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only\\ngave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know\\nthat before I take ten pounds from you.\"\\n  \"I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I\\nhave named that price, so I intend to stick to it.\"\\n  \"Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought\\nthe bust up with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!\" He\\nopened his bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a\\ncomplete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more\\nthan once in fragments.\\n  Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound\\nnote upon the table.\\n  \"You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the\\npresence of these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer\\nevery possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a\\nmethodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events\\nmight take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your\\nmoney, and I wish you a very good evening.\"\\n  When our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmes\\'s move-\\nments were such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a\\nclean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table.\\nThen he placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth.\\nFinally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a\\nsharp blow on the top of the head. The figure broke into frag-\\nments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains. Next\\ninstant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one splinter, in\\nwhich a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in a pudding.\\n  \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"let me introduce you to the famous\\nblack pearl of the Borgias.\"\\n  Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a\\nspontaneous impulse, we both broke out clapping, as at the\\nwell-wrought crisis of a play. A flush of colour sprang to Holmes\\'s\\npale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who\\nreceives the homage of his audience. It was at such moments that\\nfor an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine, and betrayed\\nhis human love for admiration and applause. The same singularly\\nproud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from\\npopular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by\\nspontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.\\n  \"Yes, gentlemen,\" said he, \"it is the most famous pearl now\\nexisting in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a\\nconnected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the\\nPrince of Colonna\\'s bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was\\nlost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon\\nwhich were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You\\nwill remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappear-\\nance of this valuable jewel, and the vain efforts of the London\\npolice to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the case, but I\\nwas unable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell upon the\\nmaid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved that\\nshe had a brother in London, but we failed to trace any connec-\\ntion between them. The maid\\'s name was Lucretia Venucci, and\\nthere is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was murdered\\ntwo nights ago was the brother. I have been looking up the dates\\nin the old files of the paper, and I find that the disappearance of\\nthe pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo, for\\nsome crime of violence -- an event which took place in the\\nfactory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts\\nwere being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events,\\nthough you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way\\nin which they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl\\nin his possession. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may\\nhave been Pietro\\'s confederate, he may have been the go-between\\nof Pietro and his sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the\\ncorrect solution.\\n  \"The main fact is that he had the pearl, and at that moment,\\nwhen it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He\\nmade for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he\\nhad only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously\\nvaluable prize, which would otherwise be found on him when he\\nwas searched. Six plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the\\npassage. One of them was still soft. In an instant Beppo, a\\nskilful workman, made a small hole in the wet plaster, dropped\\nin the pearl, and with a few touches covered over the aperture\\nonce more. It was an admirable hiding-place. No one could\\npossibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a year\\'s imprison-\\nment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over\\nLondon. He could not tell which contained his treasure. Only by\\nbreaking them could he see. Even shaking would tell him noth-\\ning, for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl\\nwould adhere to it -- as, in fact, it has done. Beppo did not\\ndespair, and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity\\nand perseverance. Through a cousin who works with Gelder, he\\nfound out the retail firms who had bought the busts. He managed\\nto find employment with Morse Hudson, and in that way tracked\\ndown three of them. The pearl was not there. Then, with the\\nhelp of some Italian employe, he succeeded in finding out where\\nthe other three busts had gone. The first was at Harker\\'s. There\\nhe was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible\\nfor the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which\\nfollowed.\"\\n  \"If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photo-\\ngraph?\" I asked.\\n  \"As a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him\\nfrom any third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after\\nthe murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather\\nthan delay his movements. He would fear that the police would\\nread his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get\\nahead of him. Of course, I could not say that he had not found\\nthe pearl in Harker\\'s bust. I had not even concluded for certain\\nthat it was the pearl, but it was evident to me that he was looking\\nfor something, since he carried the bust past the other houses in\\norder to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it.\\nSince Harker\\'s bust was one in three, the chances were exactly\\nas I told you -- two to one against the pearl being inside it There\\nremained two busts, and it was obvious that he would go for the\\nLondon one first. I warned the inmates of the house, so as to\\navoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with the happiest\\nresults. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the\\nBorgia pearl that we were after. The name of the murdered man\\nlinked the one event with the other. There only remained a single\\nbust -- the Reading one -- and the pearl must be there. I bought it\\nin your presence from the owner -- and there it lies.\"\\n  We sat in silence for a moment.\\n  \"Well,\" said Lestrade, \"I\\'ve seen you handle a good many\\ncases, Mr. Holmes, but I don\\'t know that I ever knew a more\\nworkmanlike one than that. We\\'re not jealous of you at Scotland\\nYard. No, sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down\\nto-morrow, there\\'s not a man, from the oldest inspector to the\\nyoungest constable, who wouldn\\'t be glad to shake you by the\\nhand.\"\\n  \"Thank you!\" said Holmes. \"Thank you!\" and as he turned\\naway, it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the\\nsofter human emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later\\nhe was the cold and practical thinker once more. \"Put the pearl\\nin the safe, Watson,\" said he, \"and get out the papers of the\\nConk-Singleton forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little\\nproblem comes your way, I shall be happy, if I can, to give you\\na hint or two as to its solution.\"\\n\\x1a', '                         THE SEVEN OLD SAMURAI\\n\\n   Once upon a time, in far off Japan, a band of fierce robbers had their \\nhiding place on top of a mountain almost always covered with grey clouds, \\nwindswept and battered by storms. The robbers lived in a large cave where they\\nhad piled their spoils. Now and again, they went down the mountain, attacked a\\nvillage, murdered the poor folk they chanced upon, stole whatever they could \\nlay hands on and burned it to the ground. Wherever the robbers passed, there \\nwas nothing but smoking ruins, weeping men and women, misery, mournlng and \\ndesolation.\\n   The Emperor, worried at this, had sent his soldiers to attack the mountain,\\nbut the robbers had always managed to drive them off. The Emperor sent for one\\nof the last remaining Samurai, old Raiko, and said to him:\\n   \"Raiko, you\\'ve served me for many years. Do my bidding for one last time. \\nGo to the mountain at the head of an army and wipe out these bloodthirsty \\nbandits.\" Raiko sighed.\\n   \"Your Majesty, if I were young again I\\'d do it alone. Today I\\'m too old, \\nfar too old to do that, or to command an army.\"\\n   \"Must I then,\" said the Emperor, \"submit to the force of these marauding \\nrobbers?\" The old Samurai replied:\\n   \"No, I\\'ll go up there with six Samurai like myself.\"\\n   \"But if they\\'re all as old as you, how can they help you?\"\\n   \"Have faith in us!\" said Raiko.\\n   A few days later, the seven Samurai set off on their journey, not with \\nhorses, swords, shields and armour, which they could no longer have worn \\nanyway, but dressed as humble pilgrims. From the summit, the bandits watched \\nthem come, and their leader said,\\n   \"Who cares about seven beggars. Let them climb up.\" The seven reached the \\ncave and Raiko humbly said,\\n   \"Let us come in, it\\'s cold outside. There\\'s a wind blowing and we, as you \\ncan see, are old men. We\\'ll be no trouble to you.\" The leader of the gang \\nscornfully replied:\\n   \"Come in, old men, and stay in a corner.\" And so. the seven pilgrims \\nhuddled in a corner while the bandits ate their meal of food stolen from the \\nvillages nearby.\\n   Now and again, they threw scraps of food and leftovers to the old men, \\nsaying: \"Eat this, and it is much too good for you.\" A few hours later, Raiko \\nrose to his feet saying:\\n   \"The wind has dropped. We can go on our way. In thanks. for your \\nhospitality, we would like to offer you this liqueur, it is sake, rice wine. \\nDrink our health with it.\" The robbers needed no second telling. In the blink \\nof an eye, they had emptied the goatskin bottle Raika held out to them. And in\\nthe blink of an eye they all lay dead, for the sake contained a very potent \\npoison. And so, the seven Samurai, too old to wield a sword, served the \\nEmperor for the last time.\\n', '                  THE SEVEN VOYAGES OF SINBAD THE SAILOR\\n\\n   Once upon a time years and years ago in Baghdad there lived a porter called\\nSinbad. As he was passing a palace one day, he saw a bench in the great \\ndoorway and thought he would rest on it. So he put down his load, and was \\nabout to sit down when curiosity got the better of him and, slipping through \\nthe entrance he went into the gardens. To Sinbad it was like heaven.\\n   Everywhere there were flower beds, gushing fountains and palm trees, in \\nwhose shade many gentlemen were strolling. while pages served them with cakes\\nand drinks. Sinbad couldn\\'t help exclaiming aloud:\\n   \"Well I never! Here I am, worked to the bone, poor and always hungry while \\nother lucky men never carry burdens, but enjoy good food and drink. And yet, \\nwe\\'re all Allah\\'s sons! What a world of difference between me and the people \\nwho live here.\" Sinbad had barely stopped speaking when one of the pages came \\nacross to him and said:\\n   \"Come with me. My master wishes to speak to you.\" Rather alarmed, Sinbad \\nfollowed the lad into a hall where the owner of the house was seated amongst \\nhis guests.\\n   \"Come in,\" he said. \"What\\'s your name?\"\\n   \"Sinbad, the Porter.\"\\n   \"My name is Sinbad too. Sinbad the Sailor. I hear you\\'ve been complaining, \\nbut I\\'d like you to know that I became rich only by working hard and taking \\ndreadful risks. All this during seven amazing but adventurous voyages. I \\nhaven\\'t had an easy life, you know. Sit down and I\\'ll tell you my story.\"\\n   \"My father,\" began Sinbad the Sailor, \"was a merchant. When he died, he \\nleft me a fortune. I was young then and foolish, and I started to squander my \\nriches until one day, I discovered my money had gone. I didn\\'t lose heart, \\nhowever, for I decided to become a merchant like my father. With the money I \\nearned from selling my furniture and carpets I bought all the goods I could \\nand set out. I boarded a ship at Bassora with other traders and began to trade\\nin every port. One day, the captain dropped anchor near a beautiful island and\\nwe went ashore. We had hardly lit the fires to cook our meal when the captain \\nsuddenly shouted;\\n   \\'Quick! Get away! This is no island. It\\'s a huge fish that\\'s been sleeping \\non the waves so long that trees have grown on it. The heat from the fires is \\nwakening it. It will dive to the deep any minute now. Back to the ship! Drop \\neverything!\\'\\n   Many managed to climb aboard again, but I was too far away and ended up in \\nthe sea. Luckily I found a floating empty barrel. Clinging to this and \\ndrifting with the winds and currents, I reached an island. As I came ashore, I\\nsaw a mare tethered to a stump. Then a man appeared and asked me:\\n   \\'Who are you? Where have you come from?\\'\\n   \\'I\\'ve been shipwrecked,\\' I said. The man went on:\\n   \\'Follow me,\\' he said and took me to a cave, where he offered me some food. \\nI told him of my adventure and he listened in amazement. I was dying to know \\nwhy he kept his horse tethered at the shore.\\n   \\'I used to be one of King Mihragian\\'s grooms\\' he replied. \\'When the moon is\\nfull, we tether the mares on the beach so they can meet with the sea horses. \\nThe foals that are born are so beautiful there are none like them in the whole\\nworld. This is the time of the new moon and the sea stallions arrive. When \\nit\\'s all over, I\\'ll take you to the king. You\\'re very lucky, you know, for \\nyou\\'d have died of hunger on this desert island if you hadn\\'t met me.\\'\\n   My rescuer introduced me to his friends and they gave me a friendly \\nwelcome. Later, back in the city the grooms told the king about my adventure.\\n   \\'It was Allah\\'s will that you should be saved,\\' the ruler told me after \\nlistening carefully. \\'It\\'s your destiny to live a long life.\\' Because he felt \\nI was under the protection of Allah himself, he showered me with gifts and \\nfavours. I was appointed harbourmaster; it was my job to keep a register of \\nall freight in transit and so I found myself in an excellent post.\\n   Just the same, I felt homesick, and every time a ship came in, I asked the \\ncaptain if he was bound for Baghdad, for I intended to ask him for a passage \\nhome. One day, however, as I took a note of the cargo on a ship that had just \\ntied up, I asked:\\n   \\'Anything else on board?\\'\\n   \\'Yes,\\' replied the captain. \\'There\\'s still a certain quantity of goods \\naboard. The owner was lost at sea and must have drowned. I\\'m going to see if I\\ncan sell them and take the money back to his family in Baghdad.\\'\\n   \\'What was the name of the man who was lost?\\' I enquired.\\n   \\'Sinbad the Sailor.\\' I let out a shout.\\n   \\'I am Sinbad the Sailor! I clung to a barrel that saved my life and drifted\\nashore on an island. There, thanks be to Allah, I met the royal grooms. And it\\nwas the king himself who made me harbourmaster. The goods you\\'re carrying on \\nboard your ship belong to me.\\'\\n   \\'Well, what a story! I\\'ve never heard anything like it!\\' exclaimed the \\ncaptain. \\'Isn\\'t there an honest soul left in the world?\\'\\n   \\'Captain!\\' I gasped. \\'Why won\\'t you believe what I say?\\'\\n   \\'Because it\\'s perfectly obvious,\\' he replied, \\'that you heard the trader \\nhad drowned and now, by inventing a ridiculous adventure, you hope to lay \\nhands on his property!\\' At that point, I described to the captain every single\\nthing that had taken place on board his ship since the moment it had weighed \\nanchor. He was forced to believe I was telling the truth.\\n   \\'Good gracious!\\' everyone gasped. \\'We certainly never dreamt that you were \\nsafe and sound.\\'\\n   I got my trading goods back and immediately thought of something precious \\nto give to the king. He was astounded at what had happened, but everyone \\nassured him that every word was true. He too gave me a gift and allowed me to \\nleave with all my belongings. I went aboard. Some days later, I was at \\nBassora and then back to Baghdad. I had grown far richer than before and \\nquickly forgot all my past suffering.\"\\n   When Sinbad the Sailor had ended his tale, he gave Sinbad the Porter three \\ngold coins and told him to return the next day.\\n   The following day, after providing the porter and the other guests with a \\ndelicious meal, Sinbad the Sailor again began to speak.\\n   \"One day, I again had a great desire to travel. I decided to invest some of\\nmy money in trading goods and went on board ship at Bassora for my second \\nvoyage. To begin with, it was a pleasant journey. Then one day, we reached a \\nstrange desert island. Many of the passengers decided to go ashore and I sat \\ndown on the bank of a river and fell fast asleep. When I awoke there was not a\\nsoul in sight. The ship had sailed, for the captain had forgot all about me.\\n   However, I decided to climb a tree and survey the island. It was then that \\nI discovered a great white dome.\\n   Full of hope, I marched in the direction of the dome. but as I drew near, I\\nrealised it had no doors. The sun had not yet set and the sky was a fiery \\npink. Suddenly, everything went dark, as though night had fallen. I looked up \\nand saw an enormous bird with outstretch wings, shutting out the sunlight. I \\nremembered then of hearing about a bird so huge it fed its nestlings \\nelephants. The bird\\'s name was Rukh. Just then I realised that the dome was \\nreally one of Rukh\\'s eggs. Indeed, the great bird settled on top of the egg \\nand dropped of t6o sleep. I unwound my turban and twisted it to make a rope. I\\ntied the end of it round the bird\\'s leg so that it would carry me away with \\nit. At the first light of dawn, the bird woke, spread its immense wings and \\ntook flight. So high did it rise into the sky that the earth almost vanished \\nfrom sight, but it landed on a plateau. I undid the knot. Rukh floated down\\ninto the valley below and when he returned, it was with a large snake in his \\nbeak. Nobody lived on this plateau and, on the other side of the valley lay a \\nmountain far too high for anyone ever to climb.\\n   All I could do was clamber down into the valley. When I got there, I saw \\nthe ground was littered with diamonds and full of terrible snakes. I couldn\\'t \\nhelp shuddering. Luckily, the snakes were not moving about that day, for fear \\nof Rukh, but darkness was about to fall. I found a cave and blocked the \\nentrance with a rock.\\n   In the morning, I left the cave and started to roam the valley searching \\nfor a way out. Suddenly I came upon the carcass of an animal. Just then I \\nremembered once hearing the story of a doomed valley, into which diamond \\nhunters would throw a large dead animal. The precious gems stuck to the \\ncarcass and the hunters would then wait for a vulture or eagle to appear. The \\nbird of prey would swoop down on the meat and carry it away in its talons to \\nthe plateau above. There, the diamond hunters, shouting and yelling, forced \\nthe bird to give up its prey. With this tale in mind, I filled my pockets with\\ndiamonds then roped myself to the dead animal.\\n   A little later, a huge eagle carried the carcass and me to the plateau. It \\nwas just about to tear into the flesh with its beak, when some men appeared, \\nshouting loudly. The eagle flapped away and, though my clothes were \\nbloodstained, I was alive!\\n   I told the diamond hunters about my adventure and gave some diamonds to the\\nman who had thrown the carcass into the valley. They all told me I was under \\nAllah\\'s own protection. I had come out alive from the valley of the snakes; \\nsomething nobody else had ever done before. Next day, I set off homewards. I \\nbartered some of the diamonds for goods to sell and became richer than ever. \\nWhen I arrived in Baghdad, my friends and relations welcomed me with delight \\nand, again forgetting all my trials and troubles, I went back to an easy life.\\nAnd that\\'s the tale of my second voyage.\\n   I\\'ll tell you about the third tomorrow. It\\'s time to eat now,\" ended Sinbad\\nthe Sailor.\\n   Sinbad the bearer of burdens had, like all those present, listened \\nwide-eyed to this story, and again that evening, he found himself gifted \\nanother three gold coins. Of course, next day, he hurried back to the sailor\\'s\\nhome. He sat at his side till the rich man\\'s friends came, then they sat down \\nto a cheerful feast. When the meal was over, Sinbad the Sailor told the tale \\nof his third voyage.\\n   \"Rich as I was, I wanted to become even richer. So I got a passage again at\\nBassora, on a fine vessel, together with other merchants.\\n   One day, we ran into a fierce storm and the captain began to cry:\\n   \\'The ship is out of control! The sails are in tatters! Let\\'s hope we can \\nfind shelter in the lee of Monkey Mountain. Though the monkeys are dangerous\\nbeasts!`\\n   Shortly after this, the ship ran aground on the shore of a strange island \\nand, in next to no time. we were surrounded by a tribe of monkeys. About the \\nheight of a child, hairy and smelly, they rushed about as we stood there \\nwithout moving a muscle, afraid of what they might do. All we could do was \\nstand aside and watch them swarm up the masts and tear the rubber lifeboats \\nwith their sharp teeth.\\n   Soon after, a giant wave swept the vessel out to sea, with the horrid \\ncreatures still aboard, together with all our cargo. As we wandered over the \\nisland, we caught sight of a huge castle-like building. Though very much \\nafraid, we ventured through the gateway. The castle looked deserted, but \\nsomebody certainly lived there for, in the middle of the courtyard stood a \\nlarge bench and a bonfire of logs was ablaze.\\n   We all sank on to the bench and, overcome by fatigue, fell fast asleep. As \\nevening came the ground began to tremble. A terrifying creature was \\napproaching us. It was a real ogre, gigantic with fierce red eyes, long fangs \\nlike those of a wild pig, a great mouth and huge ears. The ogre grabbed me and\\nstarted to prod me with his enormous hands. Luckily I was too skinny for his \\ntaste, so he picked out the plumpest of my companions, killed and made a meal \\nof him. After this meal, he stretched out on the bench and slept whiie we \\nshrank trembling in a corner, unable to sleep a wink. Next morning, the giant \\nwent off after locking the door behind him. For us it was a day of terror and \\nthe giant, when he returned, picked out another of our little band and made a \\nmeal of him too. As soon as he had fallen asleep, we came to a decision:\\n   \\'We must kill him while he\\'s asleep!\\' So we put two long sticks into the \\ncoals and when they were burning hot, thrust them into the giant\\'s eyes. The \\nogre leapt to his feet with a scream, knocking us over as he did. Now blinded,\\nhe was quite unable to catch us. He fumbled his way to the door and stumbled \\nout, screaming horribly as he went. We ran as fast as we could down to the sea\\nand hastily made a raft out of pieces of driftwood. The raft was barely in the\\nwater when we saw the giant coming, with an even more horrible-looking \\ngiantess.\\n   They started to hurl great rocks at us, and we were hit more than once. \\nBefore we could escape their reach, they had managed to kill all my companions\\nexcept two. Though by now the raft was scarcely afloat, it carried all three \\nof us to another island. Not knowing where we were, we roamed all day, meeting\\nno-one at all, and fell sound asleep when night fell.\\n   It was not a peaceful night, however. A giant snake crept up and gobbled \\ndown one of my friends. Then it curled up and went to sleep. Shaking with \\nterror, my remaining companion and I climbed a tree. Thinking he was sure to \\nbe safe there, my friend settled down in the lowest forked branch. This was to\\nsave my life. For the snake later finding the poor man an easy victim, ate him\\nup rather than climb to the top of the tree for me. I didn\\'t see how I could \\never get away from this place alive. However, I had an idea. Picking up the \\nplanks lying round about, I tied one under my feet, another on each side, one \\nalong my stomach, another at my back and the last as a roof over my head. This\\ngave me a sort of armour. When, late that night, the snake did its best to \\ndevour me, it could not, no matter how hard it tried. My wooden armour \\nwithstood the crushing. The reptile squeezed and squeezed till dawn. but as \\nthe sun came up, it wearily gave up and slithered away. I untied the planks \\nand set off in search of food. My wanderings took me to the tip of the island,\\nhigh above the sea. As I sat there, downhearted, staring at the water, I saw a\\nship sail past only a few hundred yards from the shore. The crew heard my \\ncries and I was safe at last. I was hoisted aboard, fed and clothed and later \\nI told them my amazing tale, which naturally astonished those who heard it. A \\nfair wind swept us safely into the port of Salahita.\\n   The captain then said to me:\\n   \\'You\\'re a poor unfortunate stranger here, but I\\'d like to give you another \\nchance. This ship is carrying a batch of goods belonging to one of the \\npassengers who vanished on a desert island. Nothing has ever been heard of him\\nagain. I\\'m going to sell these articles and take the money back to his family.\\nIf you like, you can try selling them. I\\'ll give you a commission on what you \\nmanage to sell.\\'\\n   I thanked the captain for his kindness; I was desperately in need. However,\\nthe bosun who was busy listing the cargo, asked a question:\\n   \\'Captain,\\' he said, \\'what name do I put on these goods?\\'\\n   \\'Mark them as Sinbad the Sailor\\'s. That\\'s the name of the man who \\ndisappeared. \\'\\n   \\'But I\\'m Sinbad the Sailor!\\' I exclaimed. \\'And I didn\\'t disappear at all. I\\nfell asleep on the island and when I awoke, you had all gone. These are my \\ngoods. The diamond hunters I met on the mountain, to whom I told my tale, will\\nvouch for all this.\\'\\n   The crowd of seamen and merchants that had clustered round to listen, began\\nto murmur amongst themselves. Some believed my words, others swore I was a \\nliar. Suddenly, however, on hearing the words \\'diamond hunters\\', one of the \\nmerchants came up to me and, after a good stare, exclaimed:\\n   \\'Do you remember when I told you all about the man roped to the carcass I \\nthrew into Diamond Valley? Well, this is him! I know his face. Everything he \\nsays is true.\\' At that, the captain sharply demanded:\\n   \\'What marks do your goods have on them? Which are they?\\' I told him and he \\ntoo realised that I was none other than Sinbad. That\\'s how I got my belongings\\nback and was able to go on trading as though nothing had happened. When I\\nreturned home, I saw that I was even richer than before. That\\'s all I have to \\ntell about my third voyage,\" Sinbad said, \"but if you come back tomorrow, I\\'ll\\ndescribe the fourth one.\"\\n   Thus saying, he ordered that the bearer of burdens should be given three \\ngold coins. Next morning, Sinbad the Porter hurried back to his rich friend. \\nThey enjoyed a meal and waited till all the other guests had appeared. Then \\nSinbad the Sailor started to tell the story of his fourth adventure.\\n   \"As in the past, I began to feel the urge to travel, and I knew I had to go\\nback to sea. I bought a great quantity of goods, said goodbye and went to \\nBassora to find a ship. To begin with, the voyage was all plain sailing. Till \\nthe day a hurricane ripped the sails and broke up the ship. We all ended in \\nthe sea, though most of us were able to cling to bits of wreckage and keep \\nafloat. Then the waters grew calm again and the waves washed us ashore on an \\nisland. Our first thought was to look for food and as we did so, we came upon \\na building. A band of naked men rushed out, without uttering a sound and shut \\nus up in a large pen. They brought us such strange food that I, who did not \\ntrust them, refused to eat. But, overcome by hunger, my friends gobbled it \\ndown. This was to lead to their ruin, for the more they ate, as though by \\nmagic, the hungrier they felt.\\n   In horror, I realised that the naked men were the subjects of an ogre. They\\ncaught shipwrecked sailors, fattened them up with special food and then when \\nthey were nice and plump, strangled and roasted them. While my friends, \\nalready out of their minds, were led to pasture just like farm animals, I \\nbegan to starve. By the time I was nothing but skin and bone, nobody was \\npaying the slightest attention to me and I took the opportunity to run away.\\n   For seven days and seven nights I walked without stopping. At dawn on the \\neighth day, in the distance I could see folk picking peppers. They took pity \\non me and led me to their king. I told His Majesty everything that had \\nhappened since the day I left Baghdad, and feeling sorry for me, the king \\npresented me with a silver coin. I decided to stay in that hospitable city. It\\nwas easy to make friends with the citizens, and they soon had great respect \\nfor me. One day, I noticed that everyone the rich and the poor, always rode \\nbareback. Surprised at this I mentioned it to the king and he asked\\n   \\'What is a saddle like?\\'\\n   \\'Have I your permission to make one?\\' I asked him.\\n   \\'If you wish,\\' he replied, ordering his servants to provide me with \\neverything I required. A skilled carpenter built the wooden shape, stuffed it \\nwith wool and covered it with leather. A blacksmith forged the stirrups. Then \\nI strapped the saddle on a horse\\'s back and persuaded the king to try riding \\nit. He was so delighted that he gave me a generous reward for my work. A few \\ndays later, I had a visit from the Prime Minister. He too wanted a saddle, and\\nin the end, so did many other important officials at Court. I set to work at \\nmaking saddles for them all and quickly became wealthy.\\n   As time went by, my reputation grew, and the king sent for me one day.\\n   \\'You are now highly respected and well loved by all here. But what you need\\nis a wife. I wish you to marry the young lady I\\'ve chosen for you.\\' And this I\\ndid willingly, for she was rich and beautiful. I was perfectly happy with my \\nwife and lived in peace.\\n   \\'If I ever go home,\\' I said to myself, \\'I\\'ll take her with me.\\' But a man\\'s\\nfate is always a mystery.\\n   A little time later, I went to visit one of my neighbours. His wife had \\ndied and he was desperate.\\n   \\'My good friend,\\' I consoled him, \\'don\\'t torment yourself like this. You\\'ve\\nstill a life to live. Maybe you\\'ll get married again and find a wife that is \\neven better than your first one!\\'\\n   \\'How do you expect me to remarry,\\' the man replied, \\'when I\\'ve only one \\nmore day to live!\\'\\n   \\'What? But you\\'re perfectly healthy! \\'\\n   \\'I know,\\' he said, \\'but I shall be buried along with my wife today. That\\'s \\nour custom.\\' And as we were speaking, in came the man\\'s friends and relations.\\nThe dead woman was gently laid in her coffin and carried to the foot of a hill\\nby the sea shore. There the gravediggers lifted up a great stone, revealing a \\ndeep pit. Once the coffin had been lowered into the pit, the widower was \\nobliged to follow it down, taking with him nothing but a jug of water and \\nseven pieces of bread. I cried,\\n   \\'That\\'s a fate worse than death,` I hurried straight to the king. \\'How can \\nanyone be so cruel as to bury the living with the dead?\\' I asked him.\\n   \\'It isn\\'t cruel,\\' he replied. \\'This custom has been followed since the dawn\\nof time.\\'\\n   \\'Do strangers suffer the same fate?\\' I asked him.\\n   \\'Yes. It touches all who live in this land and have married here.\\'\\n   I was aghast. This meant that my life would be linked to my wife\\'s, and if \\nshe were to die, I would be buried with her. By sheer ill luck wife did fall \\nill some time after and died only a few days later. Her relatives arrived, \\ndressed her, adorning her with all her jewellery, then laid her in her coffin.\\nThey firmly gripped me and though I struggled and protested, I was lowered \\ninto the pit. The stone clanged back into place over my head. Wild with \\nterror, I fainted. When I came to my senses I could see, with the aid of a \\nfeeble light filtering from a tiny crack, that I was in a vast cavern. All \\naround, amongst broken coffins, lay skeletons covered with jewels. Horror gave\\nway to madness. I started to gather up the precious stones, without thinking \\nthat I would never be able to take them out, for this place was to be my own \\ntomb. Overcome by desperation, I screamed, wept and swore, before dropping \\nexhausted by the wall of the cavern.\\n   The days passed. I had carefully rationed my bread and water to make it \\nlast. I soon lost all notion of time and had no idea how long I had been down \\nthis pit. Yet a small ray of hope shone within me. I had survived so many \\nother adventures and trials that it seemed impossible that I should die now. \\nOne day, the noise of rolling stones wakened me from sleep. I leapt to my feet\\nand rushed towards the spot the sound seemed to come from. There I saw a huge \\nbadger which, alarmed at my sudden arrival, fled along a tunnel. I followed it\\nand after crawling for what seemed an eternity, caught sight of light: it was \\nthe hole in the rock through which the badger had entered.\\n   In the open air again, I found myself halfway up the hillside. Fresh air at\\nlast! I felt as though I had been given a new lease of life. However, I went \\nback along the tunnel to the cavern and stripped the dead of the jewels they \\nwould never need again.\\n   On the shore I managed to catch some lobsters and other molluscs. The days \\nwent by, and at last I saw a ship. I rushed to the top of the hill and waved a\\nwhite cloth. Luckily someone saw it and a lifeboat was lowered into the water.\\nI was soon aboard, safe and sound. The ship continued on its way. It was an \\nuneventful voyage, and some days later, I returned to Baghdad and my family \\nand friends. And that,\" said Sinbad, \"is what happened to me on my fourth sea \\nvoyage.\"\\n   With that, the sailor fell silent and his guests remarked in tones of \\nwonder about their host\\'s adventures. It was late when the porter rose to his \\nfeet to leave, and again he found three gold coins slipped into his hand.\\n   At the first light of dawn next day, Sinbad the Porter went to the house of\\nSinbad the Sailor, who began to tell another tale.\\n   \"I was as good as dead more than once during my fourth voyage, but I soon \\nforgot the risks I had run. I began to feel the wanderlust again. This time I \\nbought a ship, signed on a captain and loaded it with cargo. We sailed and \\ntraded from one island to another, till one day, we dropped anchor in a bay of\\na desert island. Far in the distance I could see a white dome. It was a huge \\negg. That\\'s when I knew I had landed on Rukh\\'s island. Though I warned the \\nmerchants not to, they broke the egg and took out the chick. Just as they were\\nabout to cook it, the sky grew very dark. Rukh\\'s wings had blotted out the \\nsun. We all ran back to the ship and I shouted to cast off immediately. When \\nRukh saw that the egg was broken, off he flew in search of his mate.\\n   In a very short time, the two great birds came back, circled above the ship\\nfor a moment or two, then flapped away. We were well out to sea when we \\nspotted the birds, each gripping a boulder in its talons. The captain managed \\nto swerve and avoid Rukh\\'s rock, but the second boulder scored a direct hit \\non the prow, smashing it to bits. The ship sank like a stone.\\n   As luck would have it, fate floated a spar towards me and clinging to this,\\nI was washed by the tide onto an island beach. I found myself in an immense \\ngarden of Eden, thickly planted with fruit trees and full of sparkling \\nstreams. After wandering through this garden for a while, I came upon an old \\nman dressed in leaves, beside a spring. Thinking he must be another \\nshipwrecked sailor, I went over to him.\\n   Without saying a word, the old man gestured that he wanted to go into the \\nnearby forest, but was unable to walk. So I hoisted him onto my shoulders. \\nHowever, when we reached the spot I thought he had pointed to, he refused to \\nget down. What\\'s more, as I tried to shrug him off my back, he squeezed his \\nlegs so tightly round my neck, I almost choked. I fell to the ground and the \\nstranger began to kick me with an energy that was amazing in one so old and so\\nsmall. Then I realised I was at his mercy. Indeed, by dint of kicking, he made\\nme carry him here and there, without a moments rest. The only time I got any \\nrest was when he fell asleep. But these breaks were very short, for the old \\nfellow would not let me be. Dazed by his blows, I was furious at being so \\nill-rewarded for my kindness in helping him in the first place.\\n   As I was wandering about one day with the old man on my back, I saw some \\nlarge water melons in a field. Close by was a vineyard, the vines laden with \\ngrapes. I decided I could easily make some wine. The old man said he did not \\nmind and let me get on with the job. Several days later, the grapes had \\nfermented and when the old fellow saw me happily tasting the wine, he snatched\\nthe gourd from my hands and drained it dry. A little later, he was flat on the\\nground, helplessly drunk. I kicked him then as hard as I could and ran off.\\n   A few days after this, a storm drove a ship into the bay, where she dropped\\nanchor. I was taken aboard, given fresh clothes and a meal. When the storm had\\npassed, the ship set sail and some weeks later we reached the monkey town. \\nThis strange town got its name from the ferocious monkeys that invaded it \\nevery evening. Towards sundown, the citizens were obliged to leave the town, \\ntake refuge on ships and other craft and stay away from the shore. Anyone \\nremaining in the town would be killed by these fearsome creatures. Here too I \\nhad another stroke of bad luck.\\n   Having left the ship and gone to visit the town, I lingered at the market \\nand my ship left without me. I was roaming about feeling very frightened, for \\nit was almost evening, when a man came over to me.\\n   \\'Come with me,\\' he said, \\'or the monkeys will get you!\\' So I went aboard \\nhis boat and spent the night out at sea, returning with the rest of the people\\nin the morning. And for the rest of the time I passed on the island, I spent \\nthe night on this man\\'s boat. The owner became a friend and he said to me:\\n   \\'What\\'s your job? What skills do you have?\\'\\n   \\'I\\'m a merchant,\\' I replied, \\'but I can\\'t trade, for I\\'ve lost all I had.\\'\\n   \\'Take this sack then,\\' he said \\'fill it with stones. Go with these men and \\ndo as they do! Maybe you\\'ll manage to make some money.\\' So I filled the sack \\nwith stones and went with the other men to a palm grove on the outskirts of \\nthe town, the home of a tribe of monkeys. The men started to throw the stones \\nat the beasts, and from their perches in the treetops, the monkeys threw\\ncoconuts. Whether this was in imitation of the men or in self defence, I do \\nnot know. But when we had thrown all our stones, we filled the sacks with \\ncoconuts. Back in the town, I took my coconut harvest to my friend.\\n   \\'Sell as many as you need to and store the rest in my warehouse.\\' I could \\nnot thank him enough for his help. Every day I went to the palm grove and came\\nback laden with coconuts. I sold some and stored the rest in the warehouse.\\n   Then one fine day, a ship sailed in. Now was my chance to go home again. I \\nagreed a price with the captain for taking me and my load of coconuts. We set \\nsail immediately, calling at islands and ports, and at all of them I bartered \\ncoconuts. On Cinnamon Island I bought cinnamon, on Pepper Island I got a large\\nquantity of pepper. Then we landed on an island where the aloe trees grew. The\\nwood of this tree is the best in the world and I bought a large number of \\nplanks. Later, we came to the Pearl Sea. I called the fishermen and promised\\nthem many coconuts is they would fish pearls for me. This they did, and they\\nbrought me lots of big pearls.\\n   \\'You have a great fortune there, Sir,\\' the fishermen exclaimed. Never \\nbefore had they found so many big pearls all at the one time. With the \\nblessing of Allah, we had an easy trip to Bassora, where I stopped for some \\ntime before going on to Baghdad. There I found my home, family and all my \\nfriends again. I gave generously, especially to widows and orphans, as I \\nalways did. When all was said and done, I had succeeded in gaining nearly four\\ntimes the amount I had lost. That helped me to quickly forget all my \\nmisadventures and I soon dropped back into a carefree, happy-go-lucky life.\\n   \"Go now!\" said Sinbad the Sailor, \"but return tomorrow, and I\\'ll tell you \\nwhat happened during my sixth voyage.\"\\n   Sinbad the Porter received his usual three gold coins and went off home. \\nNext morning, he returned, and was greeted with Sinbad the Sailor\\'s usual \\nkindliness. When the other guests arrived, there was a cheerful feast and all \\nthose present praised the sailor\\'s generosity. After the meal, Sinbad began to\\ntell tale. \\n   \"Well, friends, I was so delighted to be back that my life was a round of \\nparties and festivities. Once more I forgot all my past suffering, fears and \\nbrushes with death. One day, certain merchants who had just returned from a \\nlong cruise, came to see me, and I was seized with the longing to set out on \\nmy travels. So I bought new goods and took a passage on a large ship. It was a\\npeaceful voyage till the day the captain announced in frightened tones:\\n   \\'The wind has blown us into unknown waters. Anything can happen now, for I \\nhave no idea if there are reefs and rocks. I have no charts that show these \\nseas. All we can do is pray to Allah!\\' Still greatly alarmed, he set the sails\\nto quickly leave behind the uncharted waters. But the wind suddenly veered, so\\nviolently that the rudder split apart, leaving us at the mercy of the waves, a\\nshort distance from an island surrounded by terrifying rocks.\\n   \\'There\\'s no hope for us at all!\\' cried the captain. And a second later, the\\nship crashed onto the rocks, smashing into a thousand splinters. With one or \\ntwo others, I managed to cling to a rock. We came later to a wide beach, \\nencircled by a steep mountain. Wreckage from many a shipwreck lay scattered on\\nthe shore. Beside the beach, a river flowed for a short distance before \\ndisappearing into an opening in the rock. We quickly discovered that things of\\nvalue were to be found amongst the wrecks and we picked up rubies, pearls, \\nemeralds and diamonds.\\n   Our great fear, however, was of dying of hunger for, though there were a \\nfew trees, not one bore any signs of fruit or even a berry to eat. And so, \\nwithin a few days, everyone had died but myself, and I knew that I could not \\nlast long. I decided to dig my own grave.\\n   \\'If I should feel too weak,\\' I told myself, \\'I shall lay myself down in my \\ncoffin and wait for death. Then the wind will blow sand over me and I too will\\nhave a proper burial.\\' I dug the hole, then sat down to await the end, on the \\nbank of the river, cursing my craze for travel. As I gazed at the running \\nwater, I suddenly realised that it must be flowing somewhere, perhaps even to \\na place where people were living. I had to make a raft. With that thought, I \\nset to work using driftwood from the beach. Now, in order to float through the\\nentrance to the rock the raft would have to be short and narrow, so I made it\\nthe same length as my own height and found two short sticks as oars. I loaded\\nall the gems I had found and my remaining items of food. Then I shoved it into\\nthe water and lay down on it.\\n   The current swept me under the shadow of the rock and into darkness. The \\nraft floated along, brushing the walls of the underground passageway, ready to\\ncapsize from one minute to the next. Then the tunnel widened and the raft \\nglided so smoothly and so gently that I fell asleep.\\n   When I awoke, I was back in the open air, lying on the grassy river bank \\nand surrounded by men. Their friendly looks quickly calmed my fears.\\n   \\'Welcome, brother,\\' said one of the men as I opened my eyes. \\'Where have \\nyou come from? Who are you?\\' I almost shouted at him:\\n   \\'In the name of all-holy Allah! Give me a bite of food. Then I\\'ll answer \\nall your questions.\\' At once the kindly people brought me food and drink, and \\nas I gobbled it hungrily, I told them my tale.\\n   \\'We must take you to our king,\\' said the men. \\'This is an extraordinary \\nstory. He\\'ll be interested to hear it.\\' A few hours later, we were in the \\ncity. My new friends had brought the raft too, with its load. The king gave me\\na splendid welcome, listened to my tale and said how glad he was I had scraped\\nthrough. Being curious to hear about life in my own land, he asked me to stay \\nas his guest.\\n   \\'I\\'ve learned a lot from you,\\' he told me. \\'The Caliph of Baghdad seems to \\nbe a wise ruler. I wish to send him a gift as a token of friendship and \\nrespect. I\\'d like you to take it to him when you return to your own city.\\'\\n   Not long after, a group of merchants engaged a ship to sail to Bassora. \\nThis was my chance. I went to the king and told him I wanted to leave. And \\nwith great courtesy, since I was to take his gift to the Caliph of Baghdad, he\\npaid all my travelling expenses.\\n   The moment I reached Baghdad, I called on the Caliph with the gift. He was \\namazed and wondered why an unknown king should be so generous. So I told him \\nwhat had happened. I spent almost a whole week at the Caliph\\'s court, for the \\nruler never tired of hearing me repeat my story. At long last, I was free to \\nreturn home, and I carefully laid my treasure in my strong boxes. And this is \\nthe adventure of the sixth voyage,\" ended Sinbad the Sailor. The porter was \\nhanded his three gold coins and off he went. Back he came at sunrise next day,\\nand again Sinbad the Sailor began to recount.\\n   \"As before, I craved to travel after a while. For a long time, we had fair \\nwinds. Then one day, a storm blew up, bringing driving rain, like nothing we \\nhad ever seen before. But this was not all, for a little later, the captain \\nbegan to tear his hair in desperation as he cried:\\n   \\'Pray Allah if we\\'re to be saved! This is the sea of the doomed, from which\\nthere is no return.\\' Then he took a fistful of earth from a box, dampened it \\nwith seawater, sniffed it and went on to say:\\n   \\'Men, this is a strange part of the world we\\'re in, with evil forces. We\\'ve\\nno hope of escape. We are close to the land where King Solomon is buried, and \\nthe home of huge deadly snakes. Ships here are swallowed by monster fish!\\' \\nHardly had the captain said these words than there was a terrible roar, like \\nthe sound of a thousand tempests. In a flash a giant fish rose from the deep \\nand swam towards us. We had barely set eyes on this, when a second and then \\nanother even more gigantic fish broke the surface of the sea. All three \\nsplashed round and round us, then the biggest hurled itself at our ship, its \\njaws gaping wide to swallow us. At that very instant, a great wave heaved the \\nship into the air and threw it against the rocks. Everyone on board was \\nknocked into the sea. Gasping for breath, I managed to grab a plank. Then I \\nfound I was alone, for all the others had drowned.\\n   \\'If I get out of here alive,\\' I cried, \\'I swear to Allah that I\\'ll never \\nagain leave Baghdad.\\' For two days and nights I floated in the sea, but on the\\nthird day, my feet located dry land. I was on an island, and as I explored it,\\nI came to a river that reminded me of my previous voyage. Perhaps this river \\ntoo would carry me to safety.\\n   Again I needed a raft, and set about finding suitable bits of wood. \\nLuckily, I laid hands on some precious sandalwood, which is light and floats \\nwell. The raft was soon ready and I set off down the river. For two days, \\neverything went smoothly, but on the third day, the current dragged me in the \\ndirection of a cave. Terror-stricken, I tried in vain to pole the raft to the \\nbank, but the river carried me into the heart of the mountain. This time the \\ntunnel was not very long, but a series of waterfalls boomed and echoed like \\nthunder and I was battered and beaten by the rushing waters. At long last, \\nafter running the risk of being smashed to pieces against the rocks, the river\\nagain flowed calmly and carried me along till I came to a city.\\n   By that time I was half dead from hunger and terror. An old man with a \\nwhite beard took me home and gave me shelter. Some days later, he said to me.\\n   \\'Come with me, my son, to the market and sell your goods.\\' I could not \\nunderstand what he meant. What goods? But I said nothing. Then I discovered \\nthat the sandalwood, of which the raft was made, was valuable in that country.\\nAnd so, I again became rich. The old man grew so fond of me he wanted me to \\nmarry his only daughter. I had no choice but to agree. In any case, his \\ndaughter was kind and beautiful, as well as rich. Time passed and the old man \\ndied. I inherited his worldly goods and also his position as chief of the \\nmerchants.\\n   But I quickly made an amazing discovery about some of the inhabitants of \\nthe city: on the first day of each month, certain men grew wings, rose into \\nthe air and flew far out of sight. The next day, they went back to everyday \\nlife.\\n   The first day of the next month, I approached one of the winged men and \\njumped on his back. Off we flew, higher and higher into the sky, almost \\ntouching the vaults of heaven, and I thought I heard the angels sing. Overcome\\nby emotion, I couldn\\'t help calling out:\\n   \\'Praise and Glory be to Allah!\\' I had hardly said the last word when a \\ngiant tongue of fire leapt from the sky, just missing us by inches. We dived \\ndown to the peak of a high mountain and the winged man yelled at me in rage:\\n   \\'You spoiled everything, praising Allah while we were flying!\\'\\n   \\'I never dreamt that it would do any harm,\\' I replied. \\'I\\'m very sorry. \\nPlease take me back to the city.\\' The man agreed, on condition that I made no \\nmention of Allah while on his back. He took me straight home where my wife, \\nworried at my absence, was delighted to see me. When I told her what had \\nhappened, she said:\\n   \\'You were naive. You mustn\\'t go near these folk. They\\'re brothers to the \\nDevil and hate the name of Allah.\\'\\n   \\'What about your father?\\' I asked.\\n   \\'My father never had anything to do with them, and never did anything \\nwrong. He wanted me to marry you so there would be no danger of my becoming \\nthe wife of a winged man. Why don\\'t you sell everything and let\\'s go together \\nto Baghdad?\\' I took her advice and some months later, we came home. Here I saw\\nfriends and relatives who had given up all hope of ever setting eyes on me \\nagain, and they gave us a great homecoming.\\n   Everyone was astonished to hear my story, but all were overjoyed when I \\nswore that I had been on my last voyage. And this was also my last adventure,\"\\nconcluded the host.\\n   \"Please excuse me for my complaints when I didn\\'t know you and had no idea \\nhow much you had gone through to become rich,\" said Sinbad the Porter. Sinbad \\nthe Sailor hugged him and asked him to remain in his house as a guest. And \\nfrom that day on, Sinbad the Sailor and Sinbad the Porter lived together as \\nbrothers.\\n\\n']\n"

       "'                                FOR CHILDREN:\\n\\n                                   Sly Fox\\n\\n    Mr. Rabbit sat on his front porch rocking, eating a great big carrot, \\nand looking.\\n\\n    \"Looks like Sly Fox coming down the road,\" he said to himself, walking \\nto the end of the porch. Shading his eyes with his paws, he exclaimed, \"It \\nis Sly Fox.\" \\n\\n    \"Good morning Mr. Rabbit,\" cried Sly Fox, as he walked across the yard. \\n\"Good morning,\" replied Mr. Rabbit, a slight frown on his face. \\n\\n    \"Well,\" said Sly Fox, \"as I haven\\'t seen you in so long a time, thought \\nI would stop and chat a while.\" \\n\\n    Mr. Rabbit could not be rude in his own home, even to an enemy, so he \\noffered Sly Fox a seat on the porch. \\n\\n    \"Take a chair,\" he said politely. \\tBut Sly Fox did not stay long, and as \\nhe was leaving, he asked: \"Mr. Rabbit, my mother is having a good dinner \\ntonight. Won\\'t you, Mrs. Rabbit, and your three little rabs come to dinner \\nwith me?\" \\n\\n    Oh, thought Mr. Rabbit, he knows about my little rabs and wants to take \\nus off to eat us. He pretended to be disappointed as he replied: \"Sorry, Sly \\nFox, we have an engagement for today, but if you want us we can come \\ntomorrow.\" \\n\\n    At this Sly Fox chuckled inwardly, and readily agreed to come for them \\nthe next day. Wishing Mr. Rabbit \"Good day\", he trotted on down the road \\ntoward his home. \\n\\n    As soon as he was out of sight, Mr. Rabbit ran into his house and called \\nMrs. Rabbit. \"Get all our things together,\" he said, \"and put rubber boots \\non our little rabs. We have to move quickly to the Piney Woods across the \\nbrook. Old Sly Fox has found our home and will destroy us.\" \\n\\n    In no time at all the Rabbit family had moved, and the little rabs were \\ndelighted with their new home. A woodland of towering pines it was, the \\nground covered with pine needles which made a soft carpeting. The wind made \\nmusic in the pine trees, birds sang, and the fragrance of flowers filled the \\nair. They found a huge hollow tree where Mr. Rabbit burrowed deep and made \\nthem a cozy home. Squirrels had left nuts hidden around in the old tree. \\nOwls hooted throughout the night, crickets chirped merrily. \\n\\n    Next morning old Sly Fox knocked on the door where he had left Mr. \\nRabbit. Mrs. Hedgehog answered the door. \"Good morning, Mrs. Hedgehog. Is \\nMr. Rabbit in?\" inquired Sly Fox with a wicked grin and a cunning look in \\nhis eyes. \\n\\n    \"No,\" replied Mrs. Eedgehog, none too cordially. \"The Rabbit family \\nmoved to parts unknown right after you left yesterday.\" \\n\\n    \"Ah,\" exclaimed old Sly Fox, \"Mr. Rabbit and family were going to have \\ndinner with me. My mother has planned a real feast. Why don\\'t you come and \\nenjoy it with us?\" \\n\\n    \"Oh,\" replied Mrs. Hedgehog, smacking her lips and thinking of all the \\ngoodies, \"I have just moved in and there is so much to do! Why not let it go \\nuntil tomorrow?\" \\n\\n    \"Do you like nice young grasshoppers?\" asked Sly Fox softly. \\n\\n    \"Do I? Nothing so good as tender young grasshoppers,\" answered Mrs. \\nHedgehog, fairly dribbling at the mouth at the thought of such a dainty. \\n\\n    \"Well,\" said Sly Fox, \"we pass a field where there are any number of \\nthem. Come get in this sack, and when I stop in the field we will open the \\nsack and rake in all of them we want. Mother will bake them with apples and \\nthey will be deilicious!\" This was too much for greedy Mrs. Hedgehog to \\nresist, so in the sack she went. Sly Fox with a grin grabbed the sack, threw \\nit over his shoulder and trotted toward home. \\tAfter going a long way, Mrs. \\nHedgehog became suspicious and cried, \"How long before we reach that field \\nof grasshoppers?\" \\n\\n    \"Why, you silly, greedy hedgehog, there is no field of grasshoppers for \\nyou. I am going to eat you for my dinner. It\\'s you with apple dumplings that \\nmy mother will bake.\" \\n\\n    Every hair on Mrs. Hedgehog\\'s head stood on end with fright. Oh, how \\nfoolish she had been! Her greed had trapped her. If only she had stayed home \\nand straightened her house and cooked her own dinner, she would not have \\nbeen in this sack to be eaten by Sly Fox. Greediness never pays, she thought \\nto herself. \\n\\n    Sly Fox became tired, and as a slight rain had begun to fall, he looked \\nfor a dry place to sit down. Throwing the sack to the ground and chuckling \\nat the thought of sitting on Mrs. Hedgehog, he dropped heavily upon the \\nsack. \\n\\n    \"Wow, Wow!\" he cried, jumping quickly up, for Mrs. Hedgehog shot her \\nsharp quills into him with all her might. \\n\\n    Sly Fox ran to and fro trying to pull out the quills, but they had gone \\ntoo deep. Home he ran, screaming to his mother. Old Mother Fox threw him \\nover a log and began pulling out the quills, at the same time calling to a \\nneighbor fox to bring some honey to put on the places where the quills had \\nbeen. \\n\\n    Mrs. Hedgehog crawled out of the bag and began walking slowly toward \\nhome. She thought to herself that never again would she be so greedy and \\nallow herself to be fooled by Sly Fox or any one else. \\n\\n    Meanwhile, Mr. Rabbit and family were living happily in Piney Woods. The \\nlittle rabs played on the crystal clear brook that ran through the woods, \\nwading, sailing little leaf boats, and trying to catch the silvery minnows \\ndarting here and there. \\n\\n    Late one evening Papa and Mama Rabbit were sitting before the cozy fire \\ntalking. Papa Rabbit had on his house robe and bedroom slippers, reading the \\nnewspaper. Every now and then he looked over his spectacles lovingly at \\ndainty little Mama Rabbit, dressed in a flowered housecoat and red slippers \\nand knitting little socks for the little rabs. \\n\\n    \"Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!\" came suddenly to their ears. \\n\\n    \"Sly Fox!\" whispered Papa Rabbit, his face now full of concern and \\nalarm. \\n\\n    \"Yes,\" agreed Mama Rabbit, her voice trembling with fright. \\n\\n    \"Go cover the little rabs with straw and tell them to be very, very \\nquiet,\" instructed Papa Rabbit. \\n\\n    Mrs. Rabbit quickly covered the little rabs and cautioned them to be as \\nquiet as mice. Since they were well behaved and obedient little rabs, they \\ndid just as their mother told them. \\n\\n    \"I left my big stick beside the old oak tree,\" cried Papa Rabbit under \\nhis breath. \"What shall we do?\" \\n\\n    \"Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!\" went Sly Fox again, scratching up the earth by \\nthe old hollow tree as he began to dig furiously. The poor little Rabbit \\nfamily sat still and frightened, their hearts thumping, their paws shaking, \\nand their eyes bulging with panic. Suddenly in the distance they heard the \\n\"Toot! Toot!Toot!\" of horns, and the \"Woof! Woof! Woof!\" of barking dogs. \\n\\n    Papa Rabbit whispered, \"Fox hunters!\" as his heart gave a bound of \\nrelief. \\n\\n    Nearer and nearer came the baying of the hounds and the music of the \\nhorns. Old Sly Fox was so busily digging that he failed to hear at first, \\nbut suddenly he stopped digging, and threw back his ears to listen. Then he \\nquickly jumped away from the log where the Rabbit family lived and started \\nrunning. \\n\\n    But the hounds were right after him, baying loudly with all their might. \\nThe horses\\' feet beat out an excited rhythm as the red-coated fox hunters \\nurged them on in the chase. Up hill, over the meadows they ran. \\n\\n    Sly Fox was now running for his life, but the dogs were getting closer \\nand closer. He jumped across the brook and spied a hole among some bushes. \\nInto this he slid, and as the dogs went down the side of the stream of water \\nbefore they jumped across they lost his scent. Sly Fox quickly ran out of \\nthe hole and took off in the opposite direction from the way the dogs were \\ngoing. He had been so frightened and so near death that he resolved to \\nhimself never to bother the Rabbit family again. \\n\\n    Meanwhile, when Papa Rabbit had heard the hounds start the chase, he \\nturned to Mama Rabbit and cried, \"Safe at last! Call our little rabs for \\nprayers of thanksgiving and praise to our Father which art in heaven.\" \\n\\n    After prayers, Mama Rabbit hustled about making mint tea for her and \\nPapa Rabbit, and hot chocolate piled high with whipped cream for the little \\nrabs. After that time they Lived happily among the great whispering pines, \\nnever bothered by old Sly Fox.\\n                                                          --Beulah Murrelle \\n\\n'"
